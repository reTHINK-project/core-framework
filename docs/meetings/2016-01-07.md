Summary
-------

**[Core 0.2 release](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/releases/tag/v0.2.0)**

Core 0.2 was released and main included features are integration with domain registry (Hyperty instances are now registered and discoverable per user), Identity Module working with Google IdP and Syncher Manager supporting the basic WebRTC Connector Hyperty (the very first real Hyperty Working!!).

**Browser Runtime**

The initial version is almost ready. Just missing the adaptation of the Hyperty Connector and associated example.

**Vertx MsgNode**

Vertx 0.2 was released which includes	the [Domain Registry Conector](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-msg-node-vertx/issues/2) 

**Matrix MsgNode**

No progress. New developers are starting in the project and when ready a dedicated Vertx-Matrix interoperability session will be schedulled.

**Nodejs MsgNode**

Apizee didn't attend

**Nodejs Runtime**

Not started yet and initial version should only be released in Runtime 0.2.

**Hyperty Framework**

Working on the CatalogueDataObject factory.
Msg factory was not tested yet by Vitor (PTIN).


**Core Runtime 0.3**

The planned features for Core Runtime 0.3 release was briefly discussed:
-	[runtime catalogue (FOKUS)](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/3): When ready, Robert will contact Vitor to perform the integration with the RuntimeUA.
- Generic Persistence Manager component: it should be based on IndexedDB API but there are no volunteers for this component. A proposal will be made offline which. This component should be used at least by the Runtime Catalogue, Registry, Id Module, Policy Engine and the Graph Connector.
-	Separation of the Idp Proxy from Id Module.
-	Graph Connector.
-	[Orange Idp Proxy](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/27)
-	Synch Manager and Syncher to improved to be more scalable and support the SyncObjectChild (required for Group Chat use cases)


### Pending Issues from previous meetings that were not discussed

**Runtime shared by more than one App**

Currently, and due to technical browser limitations, there is one runtime per App. Solutions to support more than one App per Runtime are [under discussion](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/issues/137).
