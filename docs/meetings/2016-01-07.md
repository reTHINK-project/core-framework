Summary
-------

**Browser Runtime**

Physical Integration meeting held today in Aveiro with Quobis and PTIN and we have progressed a lot. Just missing to return the Hyperty object at the end. Should be released next week.

**Core Runtime 0.2**

Almost done. Physical meeting with INESC and PTIN was held in Aveiro yesterday and today. We have achieved integration with Identity Module (Google IDP) and Domain Registry (Hyperty instances are now registered). Syncher Manager is also ready and supporting the basic WebRTC Connector Hyperty (the very first real Hyperty Working!!).

-	[runtime catalogue (FOKUS)](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/3): No progress reported! 0.2 will be released with nodejs HTTPS server.
-	No progress with the integration of MsgFactory and URLFactory. To be postponed to 0.3. We should think about it usability.
-	[Runtime Registry integration with Backend](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/25) Hyperty registrations done. Just missing Hyperty instances query per user.
-	[Identity Module](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/26) with [Open ID Connect IdP Proxy](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/28) inside is available. Integration done for login and association with Hyperty instances.
-	done.
-	[Orange Idp Proxy](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/27): No progress reported.

**Vertx MsgNode**

-	[Domain Registry Conector](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-msg-node-vertx/issues/2) done. It is developed in javascript and uses Java to support HTTP client connections which could be reused for the support of protofly in vertx. It should evolve in order to be reused by other msg nodes through a common API (eg postMessage like ).
-	Address Allocation for foreigner Hyperties and Objects: done
-	Policy Engine integration: release 0.3
-	IdP integration: release 0.3

**Matrix MsgNode**

DT did not attend - Protostub: should be deployable in the runtime but not tested yet - Domain Registry Conector: to look on the Vertx Registry Connector example provided by INESC.

**Nodejs MsgNode**

Lots of progress. Initial protostub released and already supports messages exchange. To look into Vertx protostub example to make it deployable. Will try to release it before the end of the year.

**Nodejs Runtime**

Not started yet and initial version should only be released in Runtime 0.2.

**Hyperty Framework**

Fokus did not attend.

Msg factory will be updated with new methods required by Vitor (PTIN).

Some issues were fixed for URL class but not yet validated.

CatalogueDataObject factory is progressing along the Runtime Catalogue to be released in Core 0.2.

### Pending Issues from previous meetings that were not discussed

**Runtime shared by more than one App**

Currently, and due to technical browser limitations, there is one runtime per App. Solutions to support more than one App per Runtime are [under discussion](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/issues/137).

**Chat and Presence**

The support of Chat Group and Presence functionalities that are required by WP5 scenarios have to be specified. Then, identify updates to be done in the core runtime. In principle should only be at Synch Manager (to be confirmed).
