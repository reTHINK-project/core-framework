### Summary

WP3 objectivesm workplan and tasks structure was briefly introduced by Paulo followed by the review of pending Action Points:

AP23: Improve description of [" Network QoS Requirement"](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/labels/Network%20QoS%20Requirement) if possible with examples. (Ewa, 15 May)-> **done**

AP3: APIZEE contribute with SOTA about their solutions (APIZEE Deadline: 13 May) -> **done**

AP9: Final report about SOTA. (All, 18th May). **on going**

AP10: Each task leader should provide some slides to be presented in Berlin. It should contain:
- overview. objectives and dependencies on other tasks
- workplan for phase 1
- methodology
(Alice, Ewa, Yudani, Paulo 15 May) **done**

Requirements were reviewed and no new requirement was added since last meeting. According to comment https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/issues/15 it was decided to also include QUIC protocol in SOTA.

SOTA work is progressing very well (~17 references) but not yet finalised. DT offered to also contribute on Firefox OS. Contributions about Jitsi, Kurento and Node.js are also still missing.

One initial short list of solutions to be reused were discussed:

**Javascript Runtime engine**
* V8/Node.js
* JDK 8 (Nashorn)

**WebRTC engine**
* webrtc.og (google)
* openwebrtc (ericsson)

**Browsers**
* chromium
* mozzila/firefox os

**Messaging Node**
* Vertx
* Node.js
* Matrix
  
The Selection of solutions should take into account its usability in WP6 trials ie solutions that are not going to be used in WP6 will not be selected.

A initial architecture draft for the runtime was presented and discussed including the possibility to have several types of runtime according to the device type eg with or without GUI, Browser or Native. We should avoid as much as possible changes of existing runtime modules and add features with extensions eg Browsers plugins. 

It was also discussed the possibility to have a "shim" javascript package to support the execution of Hyperties on non compliant runtime which would be implemented in T3.4 (Framework). 

Paulo presented T3.2 (Runtime) and T3.5 (Messaging node) objectives, workplan and methodology based on short iterations and continous integration. Runtime work will require deep knowledge of C/C++ that DT, INESC-ID, PTIN and Orange (mainly for Identity related aspects) confirmed to provide. Fokus will support on implementation tasks with Javascript.

Ewa presented T3.3 (qos enforcement) on the phone including the TURN approach used by Orange. DT (Kay) will also participate in this task

Alice presented T3.4 objectives, workplan and methodology and some ideas about implementation tools to support Continous INtegration. Alice also introduced the concept of Hyperty Template (a la Angular) to facilitate the development of Hyperties.

[D3.1 ToC](../deliverables/D3.1-Hyperty-Runtime-and-Hyperty-Messaging-Node-Specification.md) was presented and discussed. It was decided to remove specifications that are specific to selected solutions from the Specification chapter. Such detailed specifications specific of seleced solutions may be introduced in a "Implementation" chapter (to be confirmed later)

In principle WP4 will use Continous Integration tools selected by WP3.

### New Action Points

AP9: Final report about SOTA. (All, 29 May). **on going**

AP11: SOTA contribution about QUIC (Anton, 29 May)

AP12: Feedback about proposed Runtime arhitecture (All, 29 May)

AP13: next meeting 1st June at 16 CET (all)
