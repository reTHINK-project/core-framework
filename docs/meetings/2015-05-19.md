### Summary

WP3 objectivesm workplan and tasks structure was briefly introduced by Paulo followed by the review of pending Action Points:

AP23: Improve description of [" Network QoS Requirement"](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/labels/Network%20QoS%20Requirement) if possible with examples. (Ewa, 15 May)-> **done**

AP3: APIZEE contribute with SOTA about their solutions (APIZEE Deadline: 13 May) -> **done**

AP9: Final report about SOTA. (All, 18th May). **on going**

AP10: Each task leader should provide some slides to be presented in Berlin. It should contain:
- overview. objectives and dependencies on other tasks
- workplan for phase 1
- methodology
(Alice, Ewa, Yudani, Paulo 15 May) **done**

Requirements were reviewed and no new requirement was added since last meeting. According to comment https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/issues/15 it was decided to also include QUIC protocol in SOTA.

SOTA work is progressing very well (~17 references) but not yet finalised. DT offered to also contribute on Firefox OS. Contributions about Jitsi, Kurento and Node.js are also still missing.

One initial short list of solutions to be reused were discussed:

**Javascript Runtime engine**
* V8/Node.js
* JDK 8 (Nashorn)

**WebRTC engine**
* webrtc.og (google)
* openwebrtc (ericsson)

**Browsers**
* chromium
* mozzila/firefox os

**Messaging Node**
* Vertx
* Node.js
* Matrix
  
The Selection of solutions should take into account its usability in WP6 trials ie solutions that are not going to be used in WP6 will not be selected.

A initial architecture draft for the runtime was presented and discussed including the possibility to have several types of runtime according to the device type eg with or without GUI, Browser or Native. We should avoid as much as possible changes of existing runtime modules and add features with extensions eg Browsers plugins. 






New Action Points
