### Summary

Pending Action Points were briefly reviewed:

AP9: Final report about SOTA. (All, 29 May). **on going**
AP11: SOTA contribution about QUIC (Anton, 29 May) **done**
AP12: Feedback about proposed Runtime arhitecture (All, 29 May). **no feedback received**

A new Requirement label for "Service Framework" was created by Alice and work to evaluate Web Frameworks was allocated to partners. Frédéric raised the issue that any existing Framework that is selected to be used and/extend in reTHINK should not conflict with others frameworks.

SOTA work almost finished. Some existing contributions should be completed or improved and a few new ones like HTTP2.0 and FireFoxOS are expected. Some discussion around the possibility to use HTTP2.0 and QUIC. Antón from Quobis will further study this subject.

Runtime types and different strategies to support Hyperty Runtime features were presented but no feedback or comment was raised during the meeting.
