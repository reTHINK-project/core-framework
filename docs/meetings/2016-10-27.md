Summary
-------

**Next Release**

We are waiting for the resolution of the following issues:

- [Persistence Manager bug](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-browser/issues/58) -> Quobis

- [Runtime Catalogue not working at the Node runtime](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-service-framework/issues/62) -> FOKUS

- [Runtime Catalogue Persistence: Don't use cguid as key](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-service-framework/issues/64) -> FOKUS


**D3.5 and Phase 2 specs**

Not much progress since last time. Waiting for feedback from Antón regarding the impact of Interworking with Legacy domains on Identity Management.

Some clarifications about the need to filter catalogue objects according to [Runtime Capabilities](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/issues/13).

Contributions for D3.5 should be submitted before 4th Nov.

*Notes below from previous meeting are kept in order not to loose status*

Updates on specifications should be done in the new [specs repo](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs). In the [word doc](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/blob/master/docs/deliverables/d3.5/D3.5-Hyperty-Runtime-and-Hyperty-Messaging-Node-Specification.docx) people should provide the links to the markdown files to be imported from the specs repo. The editor (Paulo) will use existing scripts to automatically import these files into the word doc as soon as contributions are frozen and ready for internal review.

Recommendations for the implementation of the Message Nodes should be provided [here](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/blob/master/tutorials/msg-node-development-recommendations.md) and this link should be provided in the right section of the word doc version.

The specification tests should also be moved to the new repo spec: in a new "tests" folder?

P2P Stubs spec is finished.

Initial contributions for the Messaging Framework, QoS, Runtime, Group Communication and Policy Management.

No feedback from the Service Framework (Marc)

Group Communication has a dependency on the support of Identity Management in NodeJS. There was one initial proposal and WP4 will provide input here.

Addresses reusage was discussed including the need to also persist the runtime id. Independently of the address reusage, MNs should support subscriptions persistence.

**development status**

- [Persistence Manager bug](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-browser/issues/58): long discussion about this BUG. The usage of async API will have a big impact on NodeJS implementation and current usages at Runtime Catalogue and Policy Engine. David will try to build a sync API on top of the async indexedDB API.
- [Runtime Catalogue not working at the Node runtime](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-service-framework/issues/62). Waiting for feedback from Robert.
* NodeJS Runtime: it was successfuly used at TADHack but some issues were found with [Runtime Catalogue](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-service-framework/issues/62)

* Continuous integration with Travis has been added to some repos develop branches like the runtime core, service framework and vertx MN. It is easy to use and all repos responsibles are encouraged to also use Travis.
- Graph Connector / Global Registry: No news for a long time.
- Runtime Registry / Discovery: No updates
- Id Module: Admin GUI is now available but without persistence, yet
- Policy Engine: No updates
- RuntimeUA / Syncher: Timeout bug is still not fully fixed. A temporary fix will be provided in the next release.
- Vertx MN: no major updates
- Matrix MN: a new repo was created for the NoMatrix MN which has much better performance
- NOdeJS MN: no updates
- Json Schema Validation: no updates
- Toolkit: Support for NodeJS Runtime is in progress as well as a solution to avoid having to change the hosts file.

**standardisation**

No updates

W3C Community creation will be proposed

**paper**

No updates. Will try to provide a initial draft for ICIN 2017
