Summary
-------

## ICIN 2017 Paper

At the end the submission deadline is this Sunday (20th Oct) not end of Oct.
Since Partners don't feel comfortable with this deadline we give up having a paper submitted to ICIN 2017.

We'll try another conference.

**D3.5 and Phase 2 specs**

All contributions are almost ready but Service Framework from FOKUS. Marc will be contacted offline.

Contributions for D3.5 should be submitted before 4th Nov.

*Notes below from previous meeting are kept in order not to loose status*

Updates on specifications should be done in the new [specs repo](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs). In the [word doc](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/blob/master/docs/deliverables/d3.5/D3.5-Hyperty-Runtime-and-Hyperty-Messaging-Node-Specification.docx) people should provide the links to the markdown files to be imported from the specs repo. The editor (Paulo) will use existing scripts to automatically import these files into the word doc as soon as contributions are frozen and ready for internal review.

Recommendations for the implementation of the Message Nodes should be provided [here](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/blob/master/tutorials/msg-node-development-recommendations.md) and this link should be provided in the right section of the word doc version.

P2P Stubs spec is finished.

**Next Release**

We are waiting for the resolution of the following issues:

- [Storage Manager usage by Runtime Catalogue](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-service-framework/issues/66) : (FOKUS) no news from FOKUS.
- [Storage Manager implementation for Node](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-nodejs/issues/12) : (APIZEE) since the lib used by Quobis is compliant with NodeJS it should be straightforward.
- [Runtime Catalogue Persistence: Don't use cguid as key](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-service-framework/issues/64) : (FOKUS) no news from FOKUS.

**development status**

Besides the ones already reported

* Continuous integration with Travis has been added to some repos develop branches like the runtime core, service framework and vertx MN. It is easy to use and all repos responsibles are encouraged to also use Travis.
- Graph Connector / Global Registry: No news for a long time.
- Runtime Registry / Discovery: No updates
- Id Module: No updates
- Policy Engine: No updates
- RuntimeUA / Syncher: No updates
- Vertx MN: no major updates
- Matrix MN: a new repo was created for the NoMatrix MN which has much better performance
- NOdeJS MN: no updates
- Json Schema Validation: no updates
- Toolkit: NodeJS Runtime is now supported as well as Localhost avoiding the need to change hosts file.

**standardisation**

No updates

W3C Community creation will be proposed
