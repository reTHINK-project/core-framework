### Summary

Pending Action Points were reviewed:

* AP21: Standards SOTA summary (Antón, 26th June) **done**
* AP22: Projects SOTA summary (Paulo, 26th June) **pending** delayed until end of July
* AP23: Runtime SOTA summary (Paulo, 26th June) **pending** delayed until end of July
* AP24: Messaging SOTA summary (Simon - to be confirmed, 26th June) **pending** delayed until end of July
* AP25: Service Framework SOTA summary (Alice, 26th June) **pending** delayed untile end of July
* AP32: [Service/Web Workers experimentations](../../tests/workers/readme.md) (Steffen, Fréd, Vitor, Joel) **done** conclusion is Service Workers are not appropriate to implement Hyperties or Core Components. They should only be used to manage the cache of these components
* AP34: Feedback about [Messaging Node specification](../specs/msg-node/readme.md) (All, 15th July) **ongoing**
* AP36: Discuss Hyperty Framework task (All)  **ongoing**
* AP37: Initial specification for Vertx based Messaging Node (Micael, Alice, 22nd July)  **ongoing**
* AP38: Initial specification for Nodejs based Messaging Node (Arnaud/ Fréd , Santiago/Antón, 22nd July) initial input  **ongoing**
* AP39: Initial specification for Matrix based Messaging Node (Steffen, INESC-ID?, 22nd July) should start later **ongoing**
* AP40: Contributions on [Runtime APIs](../specs/runtime/runtime-apis.md) only input from Fokus. **ongoing** (All)
* AP41: Feedback about [Runtime Browser Implementation](../specs/runtime/browser-runtime.md) some issues raised and discussed **ongoing** (All)
* AP42: Contributions on [Runtime Browser Implementation experimentations](../../tests/browser-runtime/readme.md) only experimentations performed by PTIN **ongoing** (all)

FOKUS proposes to support a discovery API in the runtime to support dynamic binding of Apps and Hyperties, not just in design time but also in run time. M2M/IoT use case would require this. Such proposal requires further investigation with concrete use cases and analysis of the impact it may have in the architecture.

It was agreed to have a function to manage Hyperty - User association in the Registry API.

Long discussion about runtime implementation in browsers. It was decided to skip, for now, the hack to stream through postMessage(..). Two options will be experimented:
* Stream handled outside Workers and iFrames (APIZEE, Quobis)
* Usage of [Caja](https://developers.google.com/caja/) (DT, PTIN, INESC)

It was agreed to have the following contributions for the Implementation Considerations of other runtime types:
* [standalone applications](../specs/runtime/implementation/standalone-runtime.md): Quobis and Apizee
* [constrained devices including Raspberry PI and other boards](../specs/runtime/implementation/gw-runtime.md): FOKUS and PTIN
