Summary
-------

WP3 Phase 1 developments will be freezed by end of April.

**Browser Runtime**

Runtime installation is now aligned between the Runtime Core and the Browser Runtime. Android Standalone runtime alsor ready.

**Matrix MsgNode**

Matrix for phase 1 is now ready and available in DT testbed. Some performance issues (latency) are being improved.

**Nodejs MsgNode**

NodeJS for phase 1 is ready. Not sure if already deployed in Orange testbed

**Core Runtime 0.4**

-	Separation of the Idp Proxy from Id Module done. Orange IdP Proxy integration is ongoing. Moved to 0.5
-	Graph Connector: not news. Moved to 0.5
- Policy Engine: Initial version is ready but not integrated yet with demos.
- Runtime Registry: done for 0.4. [Advanced "search"](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-registry-domain/issues/8) moved to 0.5.
- Sync Manager for phase 1 ready.
-	Message Factory updated according to changes in the data model.
-	Persistence Manager not used yet by the Policy Engine and Runtime Registry. Moved to 0.5



**Service Framework 0.2**

-	Generation from plantuml of a new version of the json-schema with new structure almost ready for data objects.
- Json schema validation: pending on previous issue
-	User Identity Factory: seems not required for phase 1

**NodeJS Runtime**

A dedicated meeting was held and a task plan was defined.

**[Runtime Administration](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/issues/160)**

It was Agreed to have it as a GUI of the Browser Runtime. Antón from Quobis will lead this task to ensure a consistent layout between the different types of settings.


### Pending Issues from previous meetings that were not discussed

**Runtime shared by more than one App**

Currently, and due to technical browser limitations, there is one runtime per App. Solutions to support more than one App per Runtime are [under discussion](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/issues/137).
