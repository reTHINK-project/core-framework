* AP42a: Contributions on [Runtime Browser Implementation experimentations](../../tests/browser-runtime/readme.md) with an approach where Streams are handled outside Workers and iFrames. (APIZEE, Quobis) feedback received from Quobis **ongoing** (All)
* AP42b: Contributions on [Runtime Browser Implementation experimentations](../../tests/browser-runtime/readme.md) with an approach based on [Caja](https://developers.google.com/caja/) (DT, PTIN, INESC) - PTIN concluded caja is not suitable : **closed**
* AP43: Implementation Considerations for [standalone applications](../specs/runtime/implementation/standalone-runtime.md) (Quobis and Apizee) - contributions received from Quobis and APIZEE **ongoing**
* AP44: Implementation Considerations for [constrained devices including Raspberry PI and other boards](../specs/runtime/implementation/gw-runtime.md) (FOKUS, PTIN) some ideas about the usage of nodejs **ongoing**

PTIN has performed some experimentations with caja and concluded it is outdated and has lots of limitations. More info [here](../../tests/browser-runtime/caja)

PTIN presented some new ideas for the [Runtime Browser Implementation](../specs/runtime/implementation/browser-runtime.md) based on sandboxing with iFrames, Web Workers and local loop peerconnections to overcome the limitation of message only communication with iFrames and Web Workers. Web Workers would deal with WebRTC API through messages without directly invoking it. Quobis has a similar idea but doesn't see the need to use local loop peerconnection if the App deals directly with the peerconnection. Quobis and PTIN will go on with the experimentations that will be committed in the github to be discussed in the next meeting.

Some of the contributions os runtime SOTA from FOKUS (OneM2M and LWM2M) are related with Catalogue and Registry, and they should be moved to WP4. However, FOKUS does not have planned effor in WP4. To be discussed with Simon and Tasos how to deal with this.

Quobis, presented its contributions about standalone applications by using crosswalk and cordova.

Next meeting will be schedulled next 27th of August but new time, at 10:30 CEST in a effort to be a more Orange friendly timing :).
