### Summary

It was agreed to use Jenkins for the continous integration process and Karma for javascript testing. A draft proposal from PTIN for the github source code structure was also, in general, agreed. Quobis presented its internal scrum based agile methodology which is a good reference for the methodology to be adopted by WP3.

The following implementation tasks were proposed and in general, agreed:

Runtime UA - FOKUS / PTIN

Msg BUS - PTIN / DT

Runtime Registry - INESC / PTIN

QoS UA - FOKUS / Orange / DT

Identity - Orange / INESC

Syncer - PTIN / DT

Protostub Vertx - PTIN / Fokus

Protostub Matrix - DT 

Protostub Nodejs - Quobis / APIZEE

Nodejs - Quobbis / APIZEE

Vertx - PTIN / FOKUS

Matrix - DT 

Kurento Runtime - APIZEE / INESC

JITSI Videobridge Runtime -  PTIN?

Browser runtime - Quobis / PTIN / APIZEE

Standalone runtime - APIZEE / Quobis

Constrained runtime - FOKUS / PTIN / Quobis
