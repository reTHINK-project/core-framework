Summary
-------

**D3.2**

[D3.2](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/labels/D3.2) tasks were discussed and agreed.

**Browser Runtime**

Browser Runtime initial version will be released without the Hyperty Connector since there is still a directy dependency on the Runtime Registry to be removed by INESC.

**Matrix MsgNode**

Matrix Msg Node development is resuming with new developers. A dedicated session to integrate the Registry Connector was schedule where some issues were clarified. It is expected to have this integration done and then, as soon as the Hyperty Connector demo is running in Matrix, a new integration session dedicated to interoperability will be schedulled.

**Nodejs MsgNode**

Status similar to Matrix. Some issues with the encoding of the protostub to be solved.

**Hyperty Framework**

CatalogueDataObject factory ready and URL factory will be done from scratch. Msg factory test pending on branch merge.

**Core Runtime 0.3**

- [Runtime Catalogue (FOKUS)](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/3): ongoing integration with the RuntimeUA. 
- Generic Persistence Manager component (Quobis): To be ready beginning of Feb and to be used at 0.4 least by the Runtime Catalogue, Registry, Id Module, Policy Engine and the Graph Connector. 
- Separation of the Idp Proxy from Id Module. Specs started
- Graph Connector. 
- Synch Manager and Syncher improved to be more scalable and support the SyncObjectChild (required for Group Chat use cases). Specs agreed
- Abstract Data Class to be extended by all Runtime data objects, having a function to validate associated json-schema, will require json-schema moved to dev-service-framework repo. Open issue to propose this.
- LWM2M Msg Node: a new issue will be opened to discuss this need coming from Fokus WP5 scenario


### Pending Issues from previous meetings that were not discussed

**Runtime shared by more than one App**

Currently, and due to technical browser limitations, there is one runtime per App. Solutions to support more than one App per Runtime are [under discussion](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/issues/137).
