Summary
-------

**D3.2**

[D3.2](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/labels/D3.2) tasks were discussed and agreed.

**Browser Runtime**

Browser Runtime initial version will be released without the Hyperty Connector since there is still a directy dependency on the Runtime Registry to be removed by INESC.

**Matrix MsgNode**

Matrix Msg Node development is resuming with new developers. A dedicated session to integrate the Registry Connector was schedule where some issues were clarified. It is expected to have this integration done and then, as soon as the Hyperty Connector demo is running in Matrix, a new integration session dedicated to interoperability will be schedulled.

**Nodejs MsgNode**

Status similar to Matrix. Some issues with the encoding of the protostub to be solved.

**Hyperty Framework**

Working on the CatalogueDataObject factory. Msg factory was not tested yet by Vitor (PTIN).

**Core Runtime 0.3**

The planned features for Core Runtime 0.3 release was briefly discussed: - [runtime catalogue (FOKUS)](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/3): When ready, Robert will contact Vitor to perform the integration with the RuntimeUA. - Generic Persistence Manager component: it should be based on IndexedDB API but there are no volunteers for this component. A proposal will be made offline which. This component should be used at least by the Runtime Catalogue, Registry, Id Module, Policy Engine and the Graph Connector. - Separation of the Idp Proxy from Id Module. - Graph Connector. - [Orange Idp Proxy](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/27) - Synch Manager and Syncher to improved to be more scalable and support the SyncObjectChild (required for Group Chat use cases)

### Pending Issues from previous meetings that were not discussed

**Runtime shared by more than one App**

Currently, and due to technical browser limitations, there is one runtime per App. Solutions to support more than one App per Runtime are [under discussion](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/issues/137).
