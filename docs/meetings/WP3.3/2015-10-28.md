            - What happens if each user has different brokers - how different brokers communicate?
            - How to assure that broker has more general?
      - It will be not necessarily possible to provide end to end quality and maybe only for some segments the quality will be improved
      - Possible that some network parts will remain BE
      - There would be a new infrastructure, broker will not be per operator but would have a more global view, and would get more information about different domains
