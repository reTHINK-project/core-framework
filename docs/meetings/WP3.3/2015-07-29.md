    - Broker has the whole knowledge - what information can broker manage?
    - There is a kind of a marketplace where a broker publishes requests and network domains can offer their service - the scalability problem? 
- Kay proposed creating a global architecture for mobile and fix. Ewa - send proposition for fix network and Kay create a global architecture schema (fix + mobile).
    - The architecture was modified 'live', fix networks were added and additional connection between TDF and broker was added.
    - Is it possible to have TDF functionality in mobile and fix. For fix a lot of functionalities are done by the home gateway.
