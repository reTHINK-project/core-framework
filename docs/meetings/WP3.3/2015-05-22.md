###Participants
* Ewa JANCZUKOWICZ, Simon BECOT (Orange)
* Alice CHEAMBE, Robert ENDE (Fokus)
* Kay HAENSG  (DT)
* Paulo CHAINHO (PTI)

###Orange
* Context of the work
    * Best effort is not enough
    * Over the Network approach, In Network approach. 
    * The one selected is In-Network approach with B2B2C best effort.
* Reusing managed VoIP principles: TURN-based architecture proposal
    *	Turn server is a media relay in the media path - for NAT, mobile P2P, allows the network operator to be in the media path and compatible with the web company choices.
    *	Abstraction layer is needed (broker).
    *	In access network it gives benefits.
    *	DSCP used by Webapp to mark the IP flow
*	Objectives and beyond state of the art aspects
    *	Exploiting different IP paths
    *	Valorize SLA path segments 
    *	Collaborative trouble shooting
*	Roadmap
    *	TURN Based solution
    *	Interface with global architecture and loose coupling between elements 
 
*	How do we map this to architecture side?
    *	It is important to have some kind of interface/API  in order to allow the application to ask for a QoS

###Fokus
*	Objective: identify what we want to do for rethink project
*	Load balancing tool, that could be used between a messaging node and a hyperty, based on traffic
*	Other mentioned points:	
    *	Enforcing WebRTC through virtualization

###DT
*	Fokus on mapping and QoS enforcement – mapping is needed to assure interoperation between different network segments
*	Extract information from WebRTC flows (getStats API) by using JSON simple messages
    *	It can be used for policy enforcements
    *	Contribute to signaling of flow information towards the access network
*	Hyperty or network functions to provide a feasible path treatment regarding the requested QoS characteristics.
*	Also an In-Network approach so there are common points with Orange solutions.

###PT
*	A need of SoTa - consider 5G
*	Work on a high level API (in line with hyperties)

###General 
*	Methodology - Roadmap
    *	Presentations = SotA 
    *	Exchange documents and think about a common solution for the next meeting in order to work on methodology

###Action points
* AP1 : Presentation of Fokus tools – Alice, next meeting
* AP2: Summary: Presentation of TURN-based architecture – Ewa, next meeting
* AP3: Summary: Presentation of QoS mapping and enforcement + DT solution – Kay, next meeting
* AP4: Send existing papers on proposed solutions: Ewa, Kay, Alice - ASAP
* AP5: Decide on methodology and roadmap - all
