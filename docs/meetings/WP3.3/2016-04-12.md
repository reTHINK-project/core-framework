###Participants
* Kay HÃ¤nsge (DT)
* Marc Emmelmann (Fokus)
* Eric Paillet (Orange)
* Jean-Michel Crom (Orange)
* Ewa Janczukowicz (Orange)

###Agenda
* Update on code merging (algo TURN + broker)

###Minutes
- Kay has a good understanding of the code that was uploaded on GitHub by Eric (he got Redis and Broker working)
- Readmes should be improved because there is some information missing, e.g. port forwarding
- Discussion on provisioning of TURN server and TURN agents
    -   It is possible that TURN agents are not needed if it will be possible for TURN (coturn) to provideall necessary information to redis data base (location, CPU, etc.) - Eric provided information about files that should be modified in coturn
    -   How to calculate the best TURN server still needs to be discussed
    -   Information about users and TURN servers locations should be provided, e.g. for TURN it can be done during the provisioning
    -   If TURN agents are used, they should provide information to the Redis data base
- We should think of a test case, e.g. communication between two countries

###Next meeting - 3 Mai, plenary meeting in Paris
###Next Conf Call - 17 Mai
