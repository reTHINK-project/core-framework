####LHCB - Marc
- Slides presentation on LHCB - slides to be uploaded on github
      - Two components : broker and client
          - northbound interface - broker provides info about inerfaces to clients
          - southbound interface - client is considered as providing resources
      - Opent issues
          - RO vs RW
          - Info per device or per user
              - it is important since data models have impact on the logic of the system
              - note that security and privacy are out of scope, we assume that LHCB is a trusted part
              - Decision: knowledge about device is sufficient since easier to implement at first
