###Participants
* Ewa JANCZUKOWICZ (Orange)
* Marc EMMELMANN (Fokus)
* Kay Hänsge (DT)

###Offline Questions from last meeting
* To Fokus - can you explain key differences between LHCB and ANDSF(Access network discovery and selection function)?
*   Answer: ANDSF depens more on network operator. Whereas LHCB is operator agnostic, it does not depend on any operator and is based only on QoS information.

###Global architecture
* Global architecture taking into account different actors inputs was proposed. It was discussed and different elements were
modified/added.
*   Orange proposed using TURN server to identify the flows at the PDN gateway level (by using TFT). This would allow associating this flow with a bearer.
*   DT proposed keeping AF element.
*   Fokus advised how to connect LHCB element.
* The draft of the architecture: bscw ->wp3 -> wp3.3.
 
###Interface selection discussion
*Not sure if we can get information about which interface is used by using getStats.
*It would be iteresting to combone application and network information for the interface selection.


###Action points
* AP1: Work offline on the architecture definition (15/07 - All)
*   AP1.1: Start a document and global description + TURN description (Orange)
*   AP1.2: AF element description (DT)
*   AP1.3: LHCB description (Fokus)
* AP2: Review global architecture (next meeting)
* AP3: Discuss interfaces (next meeting)
* AP4: Decide on methodology (next meeting)
