###Offline Questions from last meeting
* To Fokus - can you explain key differences between LHCB and ANDSF(Access network discovery and selection function)?
ANDSF depens more on network operator. Whereas LHCB is operator agnostic, it does not depend on any operator and is based only on QoS information.

###Global architecture
Global architecture taking into account different actors inputs was proposed.
