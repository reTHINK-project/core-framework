Summary
-------

**Browser Runtime**

Some progress but problems with tests execution (see Runtime Catalogue issue). A more complete status overview will be provided in the github issues. To speed-up, there should be a physical meetings between PTIN and Quobis in Aveiro next week. Planned to release end of the year.

**Core Runtime 0.2**

The objective is to release it next week.

-	[runtime catalogue (FOKUS)](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/3): released 0.1 version does not include integration with a [Catalogue Back-end server](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-catalogue). Commited version is not working and breaking the tests execution in other modules (see browser runtime). No unit tests defined yet. Revert commit in order to have a fully functional version in the dev branch as agreed for the methodology. Integration with CatalogueDataObject Factory is progressing. It should be released next week. 
-	No progress with the integration of MsgFactory and URLFactory in the Runtime Registry, MiniBus and RuntimeUA.
- No progress with	[Runtime Registry integration with Backend](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/25) but more info will be provided offline in the github issues.
-	[Identity Module](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/26) with [Open ID Connect IdP Proxy](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/28) inside is available. No progress with the integration with other components
-	Sync Manager is progressing along with the Hyperty Connector examples and should be ready next week.
-	[Orange Idp Proxy](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/27): should be provided before end of year.
-	An "empty" Policy Engine is available in the runtime and a simple one available in Vertx that will be ported to Javascript.
-	Graph Connector: to be in release 0.3.

**Vertx MsgNode**

-	[Domain Registry Conector](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-msg-node-vertx/issues/2) successful integrated. It is developed in javascript and uses Java to support HTTP client connections which could be reused for the support of protofly in vertx.
-	Pending: Address Allocation for foreigner Hyperties and Objects
-	Policy Engine integration: release 0.3
-	IdP integration: release 0.3

**Matrix MsgNode**

-	Protostub: should be deployable in the runtime but not tested yet
-	Domain Registry Conector: to look on the Vertx Registry Connector example provided by INESC.

**Nodejs MsgNode**

First version for the protostub was committed and should be ready for Core 0.2.

**Nodejs Runtime**

Not started yet and initial version should only be released in Runtime 0.2.



**Hyperty Framework**

Msg factory will be updated with new methods required by Vitor (PTIN).

Some issues were fixed for URL class but not yet validated.

CatalogueDataObject factory is progressing along the Runtime Catalogue to be released in Core 0.2.

##### Pending Issues from previous meetings that were not discussed

**Runtime shared by more than one App**

Currently, and due to technical browser limitations, there is one runtime per App. Solutions to support more than one App per Runtime are [under discussion](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/issues/137).

**M2M**

Telco next Monday after lunch

**Chat and Presence**

The support of Chat Group and Presence functionalities that are required by WP5 scenarios have to be specified. Then, identity updates to be done in the core runtime. In principle should only be at Synch Manager (to be confirmed).
