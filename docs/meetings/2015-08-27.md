The usage of [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) and [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.13/index.html) to support Continuous Integration was introduced by Vitor. Partners, should provide feedback by next meeting. The goal, is to progress in Aveiro with the setup of a common Jenkins environment for all WP3 components.

Antón introduced the [IoTJS](https://github.com/Samsung/iotjs) Samsung project as a good reference for the Runtime implementation in IoT/M2M GW / Devices.
