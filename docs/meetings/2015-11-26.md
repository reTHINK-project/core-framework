Summary
-------

**Browser Runtime**

Quobis will update the issues with the implementation status by today

**Core Runtime 0.2**

-	[runtime catalogue (FOKUS)](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/3): released 0.1 version does not include integration with a [Catalogue Back-end server](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-catalogue). For release 0.2 it was decided to use the CatalogueDataObject Factory and to move the code to a new runtimeCatalogue.js to be committed today by Vitor from PTIN.
-	the update of Runtime Registry, MiniBus and RuntimeUA to be aligned with Data Models, depends on availability of MsgFactory and URLFactory that should be available end if this week
-	[Runtime Registry integration with Backend](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/25) is progressing and should be in time
-	[Identity Model](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/26) is progressing and should be in time with its integration with [Open ID Connect IdP Proxy](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/28). However, its integration with the Runtime Arch is not clear and dedicated telco is schedulled for today at 16:00 Portuguese time
-	[Orange Idp Proxy](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/27): status to be provided offline
-	Policy Engine not discussed

**Vertx MsgNode**

-	To be updated to be aligned with the data model
-	[Domain Registry Conector](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-msg-node-vertx/issues/2) is progressing well and should be released soon. It is developed in javascript and uses Java to support HTTP client connections which could be reused for the support of protofly in vertx.

**Matrix MsgNode**

No progress but should be ready to be tested in a inter domain scenario in the Hedelberg meeting. A telco to prepare this integration should be schedulled next week.

**Nodejs MsgNode**

First version for the protostub was committed and should be ready for Core 0.2.

**Nodejs Runtime**

Not started yet and initial version should only be released in Runtime 0.2.

**Hyperty Framework**

Msg and URL factory should be released this week. An attempt will be done to release CatalogueDataObject next week in order to be integrated in Runtime Catalogue 0.2. There is an initial version of SynchManager but it requires some changes.

**[WP5 Scenario Requirements](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/scenario-service-implementation/issues/4)**

An issue will be opened to compile these requirements and analyse from WP3 perspective. Probably some of them require further details (eg Global Registry or Catalogue is too high level).
