Summary
-------

**Browser Runtime**

Working on [issue #6](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-browser/issues/6) and [issue#5](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-browser/issues/5). We should have working code next week. 
For [issue#7](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-browser/issues/7) pending to clarify how to communicate the RuntimeUAStub and the RuntimeUser Agent within the iFrame. 

**Core Runtime 0.2**

-	[runtime catalogue (FOKUS)](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/3): No progress reported for the integration with the [Catalogue Back-end server](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-catalogue). 
-	The update of Runtime Registry, MiniBus and RuntimeUA to be aligned with Data Models, depends on [issue](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-service-framework/issues/7) raised for MsgFactory.  URLFactory was not experimented yet.
-	[Runtime Registry integration with Backend](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/25) is progressing and should be in time
-	[Identity Model](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/26) is progressing and initial integration with Google IdP and an empty Policy Engine was performed. Initial [Open ID Connect IdP Proxy](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/28) IdP proxy version is integrated with Identity Model. 
-	[Orange Idp Proxy](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/27): status to be provided offline
-	A initial version for Policy Engine in Java to be used in Vertx was developed that will ported to Javascript

**Vertx MsgNode**

-	Updated to be aligned with the data model
-	[Domain Registry Conector](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-msg-node-vertx/issues/2) is progressing well and should be released this week. It is developed in javascript and uses Java to support HTTP client connections which could be reused for the support of protofly in vertx.

**Matrix MsgNode**

Progressing well and initial version to be released this week in time to be tested in a inter domain scenario in the Hedelberg meeting. Integration of Registry Connector developed for Vertx should be straightfoward. To be evaluated in Heidleberg.

**Nodejs MsgNode**

Progressing well and initial version to be released this week in time to be tested in a inter domain scenario in the Hedelberg meeting.

**Nodejs Runtime**

Not started yet and initial version should only be released in Runtime 0.2.

**Hyperty Framework**

Msg and URL factory were released but still some issues with [Message Factory](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-service-framework/issues/7). 

CatalogueDataObject status unknown (no one from Fokus attending). 

User Identity factory only specified but no source code commited yet.

SynchManager is now part of Core 0.2 and the objective is to have an initial version ready this week.

**[WP5 Scenario Requirements](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/scenario-service-implementation/issues/4)**

An issue will be opened to compile these requirements and analyse from WP3 perspective. Probably some of them require further details (eg Global Registry or Catalogue is too high level). No progress on this.

**[Heidelberg Meeting Agenda](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/issues/136)**

Presented and now issues were raised
