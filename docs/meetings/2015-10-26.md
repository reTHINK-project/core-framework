## Summary

It was agreed to have a common implememtation for the Browser Runtime and the Mobile Standalone App runtime.

It was also agreed to have a common implememtation for the Nodejs based Runtime implementations for Server Side runtime environments like the Kurento Media Server and M2M/IoT runtime environments like Raspberry PI. APIZEE volunteered to coordinate this work.

In order to promote portability it was agreed to use IndexDB API by all components requiring data persistence and the [Sandbox API](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/blob/master/src/sandbox/Sandbox.js) proposed by PTIN.

It was also agreed on a [common methodology](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-browser/issues/2) to import generic runtime core components by the different runtime implememtations.
