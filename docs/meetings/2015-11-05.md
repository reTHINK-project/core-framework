## Summary

**Implementation status review**

 * bus/syncher (PTIN): done
 * runtime registry (INESC): ongoing
 * Alice gave a rough status on the implementation for the Catalogue Runtime UA and Marc provided based on this
a very detailed sketch on the current status. Marc was requested to update [issue#3](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/3) include his status report there.
 * runtime ua front-end (PTIN): protostub deploy finished including a generic sandbox class to be reused by the browser and node implementation. Currently the source code includes a web worker implementation that will be moved to the dev-runtime-browser repo. A generic mechanism to import the generic core-runtime from the browser and nodejs repos was [proposed](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-browser/issues/2)
 * policy engine (INESC): depends on policy language definition from wp2
 * identity module (Orange/INESC): focused on IdP server and its client (protostub): open issue
