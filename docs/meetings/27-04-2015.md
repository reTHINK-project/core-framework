### Summary

Action Points were reviewed:

* AP1: [SOTA](../sota/sota.md) work allocated among partners but no other references were added. Paulo proposed a new SOTA topic related with "Web Runtime Security" (separated topic from current Security SOTA work going on in WP4) and there were no objections to have it. A partner responsible for this is needed (AP?). Simon proposed also to add Firebase in the references amd he will check whether Orange will take the responsability to evaluate Firebase (AP?). -> ** closed **
* AP2: Derive requirements and selection criteria for runtime, messaging, frameworks and QoS components (All, Deadline: 23 April) ->  Only PTIN has provided contributions [here](../sota/selection-criteria.md) **Ongoing**
* AP3: APIZEE and QUOBIS contribute with SOTA about their solutions including an analysis on how they could fit with the protocol-on-the-fly mechanism provided by [WONDER library](http://hypercomm.github.io/wonder/)(APIZEE, QUOBIS, Deadline: 7 May) -> No progress reported.  **Ongoing**

Paulo, gave an overview of requirements contributed for Messaging Node and Runtime components and, according to comments received a few changes were performed notably iy was proposed to remove #19 [Message Caching](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/issues/19) requirement since this is more related with a solution than with a requirement. It was proposed to have Ewa responsible for "Network QoS" component requirements (AP ?). It is also proposed to have Fokus responsible for Messaging Node Requirements and PTIN for Runtime requirments (AP?).

* AP3: APIZEE and QUOBIS contribute with SOTA about their solutions including an analysis on how they could fit with the protocol-on-the-fly mechanism provided by [WONDER library](http://hypercomm.github.io/wonder/)(APIZEE, QUOBIS, Deadline: 7 May)
* AP4: next meeting: 27th April
