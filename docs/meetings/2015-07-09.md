The Runtime architecture was revisited according to last changes according to feedback coming from the Security Analysis contribution. Nuno proposed to avoid sandbox nesting and rename "Service Provider Sandbox" to "Service Provider Sandboxes". Nuno, also proposed to have a sandbox for the Hyperty instances. The group agreed on these changes.

Nuno Santos, introduced the runtime [Security Analysis](../specs/runtime/securityanalysis.md) contribution which was very much appreciated by the group with no major comment.

The group discussed the methodology to follow to fully specify the runtime components, including:
- to take [WP2 dynamic view work](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/architecture/tree/master/docs/dynamic-view) to further elaborate the data flows between runtime components using MSC diagrams eg using PlantUML tool.
- collect functionalities and parameters from the MSC diagrams to design components APIs. API design should also take into account APIs from existing components to be reused eg postal.js

The runtime specification work will be organised in three groups dedicated to three types of use cases:

* Identity Management: DT (Ingo?), Orange (Kevin?, Jean-Michel?), Quobis (Santiago), INESC (Ricardo Chaves?), PTIN (Paulo)-> weekly session to be doodled
* H2H Communication: APIZEE (Frédéric), DT (Steffen), Quobis (Santiago), PTIN (Paulo)?-> Weekly session every Monday at 12:00 CEST
* M2M Communication: Fokus (Alice, Mark), PTIN (Paulo), INESC (Ricardo Pereira, Artur) -> Weekly session every Friday at 10:00 CEST

Finally, the group discussed the Web programming language to be used: Javascript or Typescript. No decision was taken but a few concerns were raised about Typescript. Partners are encouraged to provide their opinions on such important topic in [this](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/issues/46) issue.
