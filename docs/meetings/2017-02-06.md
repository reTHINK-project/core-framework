Summary
-------

**NodeJS Phase 2 implementation**

- Retrieve Catalogue Objects according to constraints: Vitor followed Robert proposal and it seems to work. to be closed
- [IDM @ NodeJS](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/issues/17): see [outcome here](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/issues/17#issuecomment-261919199). Mutual authentication is not working. An IdP Proxy for Nodejs is required. In the meanwhile Mutual Authentication is disabled.

**Runtime Sharing**

Ongoing discussion about how to support cross-domain and how to sync internal and external minibus about the channel id to be used for the communication between both

**Global Discovery**

- Adaptation of the discovery lib: the Greg dataset is retrieved but still has to be processed. To clarify with Ingo whether it will use the protostub loader to integrate with the Messaging Framework.
- Global Registry / Graph Connector : Still problems with Storage Manager usage. But we've not received any request for support.
- Global Discovery: two options to interact with the Domain Registry:
  1- Using the Rest API: not protocol agnostic but easier to implement. Only Read operations will be allowed. Domain Registry API has to be accessible from the Internet.
  2- Using "message API" that is agnostic of Domain Registry Rest API. A Message Stub featuring Protofly mechanisms ie Protostubs loader [will be provided](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/issues/20): Steffen already succeed having something working but having problems deploying the nodejs enabled Stub. - MSG Node Access Control: can we use the Id Token? According to feedback from WP4 (thx JM), yes, but some work should be required from the Policy Engine. Waiting feedback from Policy framework partners (INESC, IMT)
- It seems the usage of IdP Identifiers to query the Global Registry are not possible due to the short time validation of the tokens

**Legacy INtewroking**

- Slack IWProtostin is ongoing
- IMS interworking: basic calls are now working as well as authentication with IMS Idp Proxy. More details to be provided offline

**P2P Protostubs**

P2P Stub are correctly loaded and Signalling messages for the P2P Connection are exchanged. There still one response to one peer connection subscription that is not correctly handled by the syncher probably related with the new Proxy Observer lib used.

**Others**

No progress.

**standardisation**

[Ongoing work for the W3C Community creation](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/tree/master/docs/standards/W3C). Comments and contributions are welcome,

DT (Ingo) could help in order to find the right scope.
IETF for Decentralized Messaging Framework was also discussed.

**papers**

*no progress*

EuCNC deadline is 20th Feb.
