Summary
-------


**papers and Workshop**

EuCNC deadline postponed till next Friday.
2 papers from WP3 were submitted to EuCNC.
A reTHINK Workshop was also proposed by Tasos.

**D3.3**

Under internal review.
Manuals and source code documentation are ongoing.

**Vigo Meeting Agenda**

Topics to be discussed in Vigo were discussed and agreed [here](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/issues/204)

**NodeJS Phase 2 implementation**

- [IDM @ NodeJS](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/issues/17): see [outcome here](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/issues/17#issuecomment-261919199). Problems with IdP Proxy deployment on NodeJS runtime. A dedicated telco to discuss this problem took place later where different tasks were allocated to different partnern as defined [here](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/160)
- Toolkit is still not yet fully operational to develop Hyperties for Node. But since this is not blocking WP5 developments it will be addressed later.

**Runtime Sharing**

No progress.
A dedicated slot was arranged for Vigo meeting to address this.

**Global Discovery**

- Adaptation of the discovery lib: on-going. New Discovery component has been added to Runtime Core that uses the Graph Connector to interface with the Global Registry. Integration with Discovery service has been done with Rest API. As soon as the Protostub loader is integrated with the discovery service it will use reTHINK messages to query the discovery service.
- Global Registry / Graph Connector : Pull Request to merge with runtime core master branch should be re-submitted for develop branch.
- Protostub Loader: security risks were raised and discussed. The MN access control mechanisms based in the Policy Engine will be re-used when available.

**Legacy Intewroking**

- Slack IWProtostub: duplicated messages were fixed.
- IMS interworking: incoming calls from the IMS are also now working. Issues with denying incoming calls to be clarified in Slack
- Missing feature to identify users when requests are coming from the legacy domain.

**P2P Protostubs**

No progress with Missing data sync streams setup to use the p2p connection

**Others**

New state machine should be implemented by Protostubs to improve deployment mehanism for cross-domain use cases.


**standardisation**

[Ongoing work for the W3C Community creation](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/tree/master/docs/standards/W3C). Comments and contributions are welcome. To be discussed in Vigo.

DT (Ingo) could help in order to find the right scope.
IETF for Decentralized Messaging Framework was also discussed.
