Summary
-------

All last phase 2 developments were merged to develop branches. All partners should use now toolkit "develop" branch.

**papers and Workshop**

EuCNC deadline postponed till next Friday.
The 2 papers are almost ready. Reviews are welcome
A reTHINK Workshop proposal will also be submited

**D3.3**

In Progress. All contributions should be provided in time for the internal review.

**NodeJS Phase 2 implementation**

- [IDM @ NodeJS](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/issues/17): see [outcome here](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/issues/17#issuecomment-261919199). To get a provisional solution faster, Tiago will provide the required fix in the IDM. Later it will move it to the IdP Proxy. In the meanwhile Mutual Authentication is disabled.
- Toolkit is still not yet fully operational to develop Hyperties for Node. But since this is not blocking WP5 developments it will be addressed later.

**Runtime Sharing**

No progress.
Probably a dedicated slot will be arranged in Vigo meeting to address this.

**Global Discovery**

- Adaptation of the discovery lib: on-going. New Discovery component has been added to Runtime Core that uses the Graph Connector to interface with the Global Registry. Integration with Discovery service has been done with Rest API. As soon as the Protostub loader is integrated with the discovery service it will use reTHINK messages to query the discovery service.
- Global Registry / Graph Connector : Pull Request to merge with runtime core master branch should be re-submitted for develop branch.
- Protostub Loader: security risks were raised and discussed. The MN access control mechanisms based in the Policy Engine will be re-used when available.

**Legacy INtewroking**

- Slack IWProtostub: done but messages are still duplicated on the Reporter Hyperty
- IMS interworking: incoming calls from the IMS are also now working. Issues with denying incoming calls to be clarified in Slack
- Missing feature to identify users when requests are coming from the legacy domain.

**P2P Protostubs**

No progress with Missing data sync streams setup to use the p2p connection

**Others**

No progress.

**standardisation**

[Ongoing work for the W3C Community creation](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/tree/master/docs/standards/W3C). Comments and contributions are welcome,

DT (Ingo) could help in order to find the right scope.
IETF for Decentralized Messaging Framework was also discussed.
