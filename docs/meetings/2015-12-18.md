Summary
-------

**Browser Runtime**

Delayed. Should only be provided by end of the year. To speed-up there will be some physical meetings between PTIN and Quobis in Aveiro. First one might be already next Wednesday 10th Dec.

**Core Runtime 0.2**

-	[runtime catalogue (FOKUS)](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/3): released 0.1 version does not include integration with a [Catalogue Back-end server](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-catalogue). For release 0.2 the CatalogueDataObject Factory is used. Initial version commited but not tested yet.
-	the update of Runtime Registry, MiniBus and RuntimeUA to be aligned with Data Models, depends on availability of MsgFactory and URLFactory.
-	[Runtime Registry integration with Backend](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/25) almost done.
-	[Identity Module](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/26) with [Open ID Connect IdP Proxy](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/28) inside is available. Requires to be integrated with other components
-	Sync Manager is now part of the Core. Only missing Msg Node listener to be added in order to exchange Object messages through Msg Node.
-	[Orange Idp Proxy](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/27): should be provided before end of year
-	An "empty" Policy Engine is available in the runtime and a simple one available in Vertx that will be ported to Javascript.
-	Graph Connector: to be in release 0.3.

**Vertx MsgNode**

-	[Domain Registry Conector](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-msg-node-vertx/issues/2) successful integrated. It is developed in javascript and uses Java to support HTTP client connections which could be reused for the support of protofly in vertx.
-	Pending: Address Allocation for foreigner Hyperties and Objects
-	Policy Engine integration: release 0.3
-	IdP integration: release 0.3

**Matrix MsgNode**

-	Protostub: few things missing to make it deployable
-	Domain Registry Conector: Javascript pure version provided by INESC should be enough

**Nodejs MsgNode**

First version for the protostub was committed and should be ready for Core 0.2.

**Nodejs Runtime**

Not started yet and initial version should only be released in Runtime 0.2.

**Hyperty Framework**

Msg factory will be updated with new methods required by Vitor (PTIN).

Some issues were fixed for URL class but not yet validated.

CatalogueDataObject factory is progressing along the Runtime Catalogue to be released in Core 0.2.

**Runtime shared by more than one App**

Currently, and due to technical browser limitations, there is one runtime per App. Solutions to support more than one App per Runtime are [under discussion](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/issues/137).

**M2M**

Telco next Monday after lunch

**Chat and Presence**

The support of Chat Group and Presence functionalities that are required by WP5 scenarios have to be specified. Then, identity updates to be done in the core runtime. In principle should only be at Synch Manager (to be confirmed).
