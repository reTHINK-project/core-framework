### Summary

#### D3.1

D3.1 is almost complete and will be released today for internal review that should be finished by 24th September, next week. The reviews will be done in the word doc version. Internal Reviewers are:

- Alice (FOKUS)
- Frédèric (APIZEE)
- Simon (ORANGE)
- Yudani (Quobis)

#### tasks

The following distribution of implementation tasks was agreed:

Runtime UA - FOKUS (PTIN)

Msg BUS - PTIN (DT)

Msg BUS (PEP/PDP) - INESC (PTIN)

Runtime Registry - INESC (PTIN)

Identity - Orange (INESC)

Syncher - PTIN (Quobis)

QoS UA - Orange (Fokus / DT)

Protostub Vertx - PTIN (INESC)

Protostub Matrix - DT 

Protostub Node.js - Quobis (APIZEE)

Node.js Msg Node - APIZEE (Quobbis)

Vertx - PTIN (INESC)

Matrix - DT 

Browser runtime - Quobis (APIZEE)

Standalone runtime - APIZEE (Quobis)

M2M runtime - FOKUS (INESC, PTIN, Quobis)

Kurento Runtime - APIZEE (INESC)

#### Roadmap

In general partners agreed to have releases very often ie every 4 weeks there will be a Core Runtime release and a Runtime release (implementation of the common Core Runtime in a specific runtime type like Browser, Standalone and M2M/IoT Runtime ). All partners should provide feedback into the current proposal for features to be provided in first Core 0.1 and Runtime 0.1 releases which won't have any dependency on WP4 components.

comment by @emmelmann-fokus : In general, some partners also noted that the presented milestone time plan is extremely ambitious and extremly likely to fail.  A precise description of the scenario and functionality that is required for D3.2 and D3.3 is necessary.  Then, this work can be devided into smaler "programming jobs", each that can be achieved in 4 weeks max.  Then, and this should be the final step, those programming jobs can be assigned to montly (sub-) milestones.
