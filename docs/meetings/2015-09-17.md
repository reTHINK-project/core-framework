#### Roadmap

In general partners agreed to have releases very often ie every 4 weeks there will be a Core Runtime release and a Runtime release (implementation of the common Core Runtime in a specific runtime type like Browser, Standalone and M2M/IoT Runtime ). All partners should provide feedback into the current proposal for features to be provided in first Core 0.1 and Runtime 0.1 releases which won't have any dependency on WP4 components.
