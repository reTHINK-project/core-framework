Summary
-------

**[D3.2](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/labels/D3.2)**

Any progress on this besides initial description of the Hyperty concept done by Paulo. It is noted that partners should work on this asap. It is expected to have "almost" final contributions, next week.

**[Runtime Administration](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/issues/160)**

Briefly introduced the idea about having a Runtime Administration GUI for some components including Identity Module and Graph Connector. Partners should provide feedback until next meeting.

**[LWM2M Integration](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/issues/159)**

A short summary about the proposal to integrate LWM2M devices from FOKUS with a Nodejs Runtime Server. Waiting for feedback from FOKUS.

**Browser Runtime**

Initial version was released without the Hyperty Connector example since there is still a directy dependency on the Runtime Registry to be removed by INESC. Standalone Android and iOS Runtime are ongoing and should be published in a separated repo.

**Vertx MsgNode**

Progressing well to support the next version of Data Synch.

**Matrix MsgNode**

Matrix Msg Node development is progressing well. As soon as the Hyperty Connector demo is running in Matrix, a new integration session dedicated to interoperability will be schedulled. Facing some issues with making the protostub and Matrix working, which should be reported in a issue to be considered in next versions and also in the development documentation.

**Nodejs MsgNode**

Still some issues with the protostub deployment in the Runtime.

**Hyperty Framework**

Feedback about Msg factory tests discussed and agreed on changes to be performed. Some discussion about how to deal with cross referencing in the JSON Schema validation for the abstract data object class. Alice, will propose to have some json-schemas in the same file. Then, Micael will try to incorporate these changes in the json-schema generator.

**Core Runtime 0.3**

-	[Runtime Catalogue (FOKUS)](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/3): it should only be a matter of updating to the new Hyperty / Protostub configuration spec.
-	Separation of the Idp Proxy from Id Module. No progress
-	Graph Connector: TUB didn't attend
-	Synch Manager and Syncher: new specs implemented. Moving to ChildrenDataObject implementation
-	[Support Data Object Schema in the Catalogue Runtime](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/43): some issues about how to deal with cross-referencing in the json-schema. Paulo, mentioned it shouldn't be a problem for the sync-manager purposes. To be better explained in the issue. -

**Core Runtime 0.4**

-	Generic Persistence Manager component (Quobis): not discussed.
-	Policy Engine: no progress

### Pending Issues from previous meetings that were not discussed

**Runtime shared by more than one App**

Currently, and due to technical browser limitations, there is one runtime per App. Solutions to support more than one App per Runtime are [under discussion](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/issues/137).
