### Summary

Pending Action Points were reviewed:

* AP21: Standards SOTA summary (Antón, 26th June) **pending** delayed until end of July
* AP22: Projects SOTA summary (Paulo, 26th June) **pending** delayed until end of July
* AP23: Runtime SOTA summary (Paulo, 26th June) **pending** delayed until end of July
* AP24: Messaging SOTA summary (Simon - to be confirmed, 26th June) **pending** delayed until end of July
* AP25: Service Framework SOTA summary (Alice, 26th June) **pending** delayed untile end of July
* AP32: [Service/Web Workers experimentations](../../tests/workers/readme.md) (Steffen, Fréd, Vitor, Joel) **done** conclusion is Service Workers are not appropriate to implement Hyperties or Core Components. They should only be used to manage the cache of these components
* AP34: Feedback about [Messaging Node specification](../specs/msg-node/readme.md) (All, 15th July) **ongoing**
* AP36: Discuss Hyperty Framework task (All)  **ongoing**
* AP37: Initial specification for Vertx based Messaging Node (Micael, Alice, 22nd July)  **ongoing**
* AP38: Initial specification for Nodejs based Messaging Node (Arnaud/ Fréd , Santiago/Antón, 22nd July)  **ongoing**
* AP39: Initial specification for Matrix based Messaging Node (Steffen, INESC-ID?, 22nd July)  **ongoing**
* AP40: Contributions on [Runtime APIs](../specs/runtime/runtime-apis.md) (All)
* AP41: Feedback about [Runtime Browser Implementation](../specs/runtime/browser-runtime.md) (All)
* AP42: Contributions on [Runtime Browser Implementation experimentations](../../tests/browser-runtime/readme.md) (all)

**Discovery in the Runtime**
Discussion about dynamic binding of Apps and Hyperties, not just in design time but also in run time. M2M/IoT use case would require this.

**Registry API**
A function to manage Hyperty - User association 

Experimentations:
* stream though postMessage(..) will not be considered for now
* Stream handled outside Workers and iFrames (APIZEE, Quobis)
* Caja (DT, PTIN)
