Summary
-------

**Implementation status review**

-	bus/syncher (PTIN): updated with MiniBUS being now extended by MsgBUS. Minor impact in the Protostub Constructor (MiniBus is now an input parameter)
-	runtime registry (INESC):
-	runtime catalogue (FOKUS): initial version done and already integrated with a [Catalogue Back-end server](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-catalogue). Still some [ongoing discussions on the Catalogue Data Object model](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/architecture/issues/65) that will only be considered for release 0.2. It was decided to close [release 0.1 Runtime Catalogue issue](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/3) and open a new one for release 0.2.
-	runtime ua front-end (PTIN): done
-	policy engine (INESC): Not much progress since there is a dependency on [WP2 Policy Language and Policy Data Model](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/architecture/tree/master/Policies-in-reTHINK) which is not progressing. Ricardo Chaves will open an issue in WP2 to discuss this and to request some guidance from T2.3 leader.
-	identity module (Orange/INESC): Not much progress. INESC will coordinate this work with Orange and will schedule a telco to progress on this.
-	vertx incl protostub (PTIN): released in 0.1.0. bug fixed in 0.1.1
-	nodejs incl protostub (APIZEE): no progress reported.
-	browser runtime (Quobis): Also no progress reported. Anton will carefuly analyse if we need to delay runtime 0.1 release. It was requested to distribute work among involved partners (APIZEE, ?) by opening and assigning implementation issues in the dev repo. A dedicated Telco might be schedulled to promote development progress whichi could be colocated with the nodejs telco.
-	matrix incl protostub (DT): progressing well. Initial version should be committed this week. It should be possible to include in release 0.2 interoperability use case between Vertx and Matrix with protofly supported in the runtime. Protofly supported on the msg node is only planned for 0.3 and we should analyse to have a common solution for the 3 msg nodes reusing as much as possible runtime functionalities.
-	Hyperty Framework: specification and development is progressing well. Initial version should be released mid November as planned. It will be created an issue to discuss the usage of having a JSON-Schema validation functionality

**Improve Specs Highlighting what is dynamic**

**Dependencies on other WPs**

-	WP2 Data Models and Interfaces: some ongoing discussions where all partners must participate as mentioned in the last board meeting. It is critical for release 0.2 to have a stable version of required data models
-	WP4 Catalogue server: there is already a functional version
-	WP4 Domain Registry: INESC reported its development is progressing well and an initial version should be available intime for release 0.2
-	WP4 IdP: Orange also reported there is already a functional version supporting Open Id Connect and not problem to use it for release 0.2

**Next Releases**
