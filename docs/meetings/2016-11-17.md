Summary
-------


**D3.5 and Phase 2 specs**

All contributions are almost ready but Service Framework from FOKUS.
**Update** Fokus and partenr' contribution ready for integration of of Nov 7 (https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/issues/175)

QoS Control specs are still ongoing. The main issue is lack of consistence between TURN based solution and LHCB based solution. Also not clear if the integration will be at MN or with a Javascript lib.
**Uptate:**  
  * The LHCB provides support for decision to control the QoS and hence may complement TURN providing end-to-end QoS by making means available to gather information about the (last hop, wireless) link status.  Interfaces are specified [here](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/tree/master/qos)
  * One example of message flows (dynamic view) to illustrate on how to retrieve information from the LHCB about the last hop (wireless) connection status is given [here](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/tree/master/dynamic-view/qos).
  * A full [dockerized implementation of the LHCB](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-qos-support/issues/14) for interface testing has been provide.  Detailed spec of messages is available as an [overview](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-qos-support/tree/master/lhcb) and a [detailed spec](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-qos-support/blob/master/lhcb/LWM2M-Connectivity-Monitoring-Object.md)
  * The choosen approch is fully standardized and allows for interaction within reTHINK as well as with non-reTHINK components



Contributions for D3.5 should be submitted till 7th Nov.

Updates on specifications should be done in the new [specs repo](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs). In the [word doc](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/blob/master/docs/deliverables/d3.5/D3.5-Hyperty-Runtime-and-Hyperty-Messaging-Node-Specification.docx) people should provide the links to the markdown files to be imported from the specs repo. The editor (Paulo) will use existing scripts to automatically import these files into the word doc as soon as contributions are frozen and ready for internal review.

**Next Release**

We are waiting for the resolution of the following issues:

- [Karma tests failing](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-service-framework/issues/68) -> FOKUS, INESC-ID? **issue closed, done**
- [Storage Manager used by Browser](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-browser/issues/58) -> Quobis
- [Storage Manager implementation for Node](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-nodejs/issues/12) -> APIZEE
- [Runtime Catalogue Persistence: Don't use cguid as key](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-service-framework/issues/64) -> FOKUS **issue closed, done**

**development status**


* Continuous integration with Travis has been added to some repos develop branches like the runtime core, service framework and vertx MN. It is easy to use and all repos responsibles are encouraged to also use Travis.
- New separated Runtime Address Allocation functionality: work in progress
- Graph Connector / Global Registry: No news for a long time.
- Runtime Registry / Discovery: Work in progress to support reusage of addresses
- Id Module: work in progress to use the storage manager
- Policy Engine: No updates
- RuntimeUA / Syncher: Work in progress to support reusage of addresses
- Vertx MN: merged the address allocation in a single functionality
- Matrix MN: no updates
- NOdeJS MN: no updates
- Json Schema Validation: no updates
- Toolkit: updated to use storage manager. Some bugs fixed
