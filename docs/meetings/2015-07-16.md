### Summary

Pending Action Points were reviewed:

* AP12: General Feedback about [Runtime Arch](../specs/runtime/runtime-architecture.md) to be discussed [here](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/issues/41), (All, ongoing). Nor further feedback received. Arch considered stable and close this AP.
* AP21: Standards SOTA summary (Antón, 26th June) **pending** delayed until end of July
* AP22: Projects SOTA summary (Paulo, 26th June) **pending** delayed until end of July
* AP23: Runtime SOTA summary (Paulo, 26th June) **pending** delayed until end of July
* AP24: Messaging SOTA summary (Simon - to be confirmed, 26th June) **pending** delayed until end of July
* AP25: Service Framework SOTA summary (Alice, 26th June) **pending** delayed untile end of July
* AP32: [Service/Web Workers experimentations](../../tests/workers/readme.md) (Steffen, Fréd, Vitor, Joel). **ongoin**
* AP33: [Data Synchronisation experimentations](../../tests/data-synch/readme.md) (Santiago?, Alice?, Micael?, Inesc?) **closed**
* AP34: [Messaging Node specification](../specs/msg-node/readme.md) (All, 15th July) **on going**
* AP35: Resume Task Hyperty Framework with a Github Issue (Alice) **closed**

Different results with Service/Web Workers experimentation:
* Victor and Micael found ServiceWorkers.postMessage() would not fit our needs
* Steffen experience is good and didn't find problems using postMessage(..)

Steffen will push his experience into Github and the experience will be further discussed offline.

Micael and Alice had good results with object.observe() experience and they recommend its usage for data binding/synchronisation.

The work on the runtime dynamic view was briefly reviewed. 
The Messaging Node was presented and discussed. No major changes should be needed. Partners are encouraged to further review it provide feedback. It was also decided to allocate work on the specifications for the different solutions to be used:

* Vertx: Micael (PTIN) and Alice (FOKUS)
* Node.js: Arnaud/ Fréd (Apizee), Santiago/Antón (Quobis)
* Matrix: Steffen (DT), Inesc (?)

Hyperty Service Framework was briefly discussed. There is a big dependency on the final design of the Runtime APIs but in principle it won't be possible or useful to reuse existing frameworks like Angular. Discussion should go on offline in the github issue opened by Alice.

Deliverable status was briefly reviewed where Nuno shortly described its security analysis for standalone applications.
