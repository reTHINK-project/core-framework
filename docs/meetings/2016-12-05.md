Summary
-------

**D3.5**

Only missing internal review from Marc that should be provided latest tomorrow morning. At this point no major remarks coming from the internal review.

**Phase 2 specs**

Open an issue to clarify how to implement the integration of QoS control

**NodeJS Phase 2 implementation**

- No feedback about httpRequest lib update to support post methods: David (Quobis), Jamal (APIZEE)
- Retrieve Catalogue Objects according to constraints: in progress: FOKUS
- [IDM @ NodeJS](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/issues/17): see [outcome here](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/issues/17#issuecomment-261919199)
- Reporter not supported by last node versions. Experimenting older versions. In progress. Jamal (APIZEE), Vitor (ALB)


- Global Registry / Graph Connector : Integration of the Graph Connector in the runtime core is ongoing.
- Global Discovery: two options to interact with the Domain Registry:
  1- Using the Rest API: not protocol agnostic but easier to implement. Only Read operations will be allowed. Domain Registry API has to be accessible from the Internet.
  2- Using "message API" that is agnostic of Domain Registry Rest API. A Message Stub featuring Protofly mechanisms ie Protostubs loader [will be provided](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/issues/20).
- [IDM for Legacy Interworking (also with WP6)](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/issues/4): see [outcome here](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/issues/11#issuecomment-261282625)

**development status**


* Continuous integration with Travis has been added to some repos develop branches like the runtime core, service framework and vertx MN. It is easy to use and all repos responsibles are encouraged to also use Travis.
- NodeJS Runtime:
- Graph Connector / Global Registry: integration ongoing.
- Runtime Registry / Discovery: Work in progress to support reusage of addresses. Almost ready.
- Id Module: work in progress to use the storage manager
- Policy Engine: work in progress to use the storage manager
- RuntimeUA / Syncher: Work in progress to support reusage of addresses. Almost ready.
- Vertx MN: no updates
- Matrix MN: no updates
- NOdeJS MN: no updates
- Json Schema Validation: no updates
- Toolkit: no updates
- Runtime Browser Sharing: no updates
- Interworking with legacy domains: ongoing. See above.

**standardisation**

W3C Community creation will be proposed. DT (Ingo) could help in order to find the right scope.
IETF for Decentralized Messaging Framework was also discussed.


**papers**

Initial input will have to be summarised and adapted.
