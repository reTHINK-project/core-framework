### Summary

[Action points and its allocation among partners to edit D3.1 was performed](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/labels/D3.1)

Runtime architecture and its security analysis was presented in detail and discussed. It was agreed to add a "QoS UA" new component to handle QoS on the device.

The [protocol stub deployment use case](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/blob/master/docs/specs/runtime/dynamic-view/basics/deploy-protostub.md) was discussed in detail including a more formal definition of the [Resource URL path](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/architecture/blob/master/docs/interface-design/resource-path.md) to be used.

The current QoS Architecture was remotely presented by Kay. Since the QoS broker has to interface with a number of undefined Network Element, the protosol on-the-fly could be appropriate.
