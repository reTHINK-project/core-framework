**Other Business**

* In order to improve the specs it was decided to highlight in message examples of the runtime procedures, the dynamic part of the message.
* it was also agreed as a good practice, to include links to specs to be followed in the description of the github milestone.
* regarding the methodology, it was agreed to skip the repository name from the github tags releases
* PTIN will open an issue to discuss the usage of Gulp to avoid as much as possible mistakes when executing git commands
