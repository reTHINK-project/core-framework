Summary
-------

**Phase 2 specs**

Open an issue about the integration of QoS control


**WP3-WP4 Joint session**

- Global Registry / Graph Connector : Integration of the Graph Connector in the runtime core is ongoing.
- Global Discovery: two options to interact with the Domain Registry:
  1- Using the Rest API: not protocol agnostic but easier to implement. Only Read operations will be allowed. Domain Registry API has to be accessible from the Internet.
  2- Using "message API" that is agnostic of Domain Registry Rest API. A Message Stub featuring Protofly mechanisms ie Protostubs loader [will be provided](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/issues/20).
- [IDM for Legacy Interworking (also with WP6)](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/issues/4): see [outcome here](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/issues/11#issuecomment-261282625)
- [IDM @ NodeJS](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/issues/17): see [outcome here](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/issues/17#issuecomment-261919199)

**D3.5**

No remarks. Waiting for internal review by 23rd Nov

**Phase 2 specs**

QoS Control specs are still ongoing. The main issue is lack of consistence between TURN based solution and LHCB based solution. Also not clear if the integration will be at MN or with a Javascript lib:
  * The LHCB provides support for decision to control the QoS and hence may complement TURN providing end-to-end QoS by making means available to gather information about the (last hop, wireless) link status.  Interfaces are specified [here](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/tree/master/qos)
  * One example of message flows (dynamic view) to illustrate on how to retrieve information from the LHCB about the last hop (wireless) connection status is given [here](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/tree/master/dynamic-view/qos).
  * A full [dockerized implementation of the LHCB](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-qos-support/issues/14) for interface testing has been provide.  Detailed spec of messages is available as an [overview](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-qos-support/tree/master/lhcb) and a [detailed spec](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-qos-support/blob/master/lhcb/LWM2M-Connectivity-Monitoring-Object.md)
  * The choosen approch is fully standardized and allows for interaction within reTHINK as well as with non-reTHINK components

**development status**


* Continuous integration with Travis has been added to some repos develop branches like the runtime core, service framework and vertx MN. It is easy to use and all repos responsibles are encouraged to also use Travis.
- NodeJS Runtime:
 - Reporter not supported by last node versions. Experimenting older versions.
 - Retrieve Catalogue Objects according to constraints: pending on httpRequests lib support of HTTP post with payload for Browser and Node.
- Graph Connector / Global Registry: integration ongoing.
- Runtime Registry / Discovery: Work in progress to support reusage of addresses. Almost ready.
- Id Module: work in progress to use the storage manager
- Policy Engine: work in progress to use the storage manager
- RuntimeUA / Syncher: Work in progress to support reusage of addresses. Almost ready.
- Vertx MN: no updates
- Matrix MN: no updates
- NOdeJS MN: no updates
- Json Schema Validation: no updates
- Toolkit: no updates
- Runtime Browser Sharing: no updates
- Interworking with legacy domains: ongoing. See above.

**standardisation**

W3C Community creation will be proposed. DT (Ingo) could help in order to find the right scope.
IETF for Decentralized Messaging Framework was also discussed.


**papers**

Initial input will have to be summarised and adapted.
