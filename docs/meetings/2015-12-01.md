Summary
-------

**Browser Runtime**

Delayed. Should only provided by end of the year

**Core Runtime 0.2**

-	[runtime catalogue (FOKUS)](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/3): released 0.1 version does not include integration with a [Catalogue Back-end server](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-catalogue). For release 0.2 the CatalogueDataObject Factory is used. Initial version commited but not tested yet.
-	the update of Runtime Registry, MiniBus and RuntimeUA to be aligned with Data Models, depends on availability of MsgFactory and URLFactory.
-	[Runtime Registry integration with Backend](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/25) almost done.
-	[Identity Model](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/26) with [Open ID Connect IdP Proxy](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/28) inside is available. Requires to be integrated with other components.
-	[Orange Idp Proxy](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/27): should be provided before end of year
-	An "empty" Policy Engine is available in the runtime and a simple one available in Vertx that will be ported to Javascript.

**Vertx MsgNode**

-	[Domain Registry Conector](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-msg-node-vertx/issues/2) successful integrated. It is developed in javascript and uses Java to support HTTP client connections which could be reused for the support of protofly in vertx.
-	Address Allocation for foreigner Hyperties and Objects
-	Policy Engine integration
-	IdP integration

**Matrix MsgNode**

-	Protostub: few things n«missing to make it deployable
-	Domain Registry Conector: Javascript pure version provided by INESC should be enough


**Nodejs MsgNode**

First version for the protostub was committed and should be ready for Core 0.2.

**Nodejs Runtime**

Not started yet and initial version should only be released in Runtime 0.2.

**Hyperty Framework**

Msg and URL factory should be released this week. An attempt will be done to release CatalogueDataObject next week in order to be integrated in Runtime Catalogue 0.2. There is an initial version of SynchManager but it requires some changes.

**M2M**



**[WP5 Scenario Requirements](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/scenario-service-implementation/issues/4)**

An issue will be opened to compile these requirements and analyse from WP3 perspective. Probably some of them require further details (eg Global Registry or Catalogue is too high level).
