Summary
-------

**Innovation Questionnaire**

An [issue](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/issues/182) was created to discuss this Questionnaire that should be filled in before the review next week.

Two innovations are proposed from WP3:

* Messaging Framework
* Hyperty service Framework

WP4 is proposing the Trust Framework

**D3.5 and Phase 2 specs**


Updates on specifications should be done in the new [specs repo](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs). In the [word doc](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/blob/master/docs/deliverables/d3.5/D3.5-Hyperty-Runtime-and-Hyperty-Messaging-Node-Specification.docx) people should provide the links to the markdown files to be imported from the specs repo. The editor (Paulo) will use existing scripts to automatically import these files into the word doc as soon as contributions are frozen and ready for internal review.

Recommendations for the implementation of the Message Nodes should be provided [here](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/blob/master/tutorials/msg-node-development-recommendations.md) and this link should be provided in the right section of the word doc version.

The specification tests should also be moved to the new repo spec: in a new "tests" folder?

P2P Stubs spec is finished.

Initial contributions for the Messaging Framework, QoS, Runtime, Group Communication and Policy Management.

No feedback from the Service Framework (Marc)

Group Communication has a dependency on the support of Identity Management in NodeJS. There one initial proposal and WP4 will provide input here.

Addresses reusage was discussed including the need to also persist the runtime id. Independently of the address reusage, MNs should support subscriptions persistence.

**development status**

* NodeJS Runtime: no updates. Still pending clarification about the distribution of bundles namely the usage of npm install instead of the catalogue. APIZEE will provide more info in the github issue
- Graph Connector / Global Registry: TUB didn't attend.
- Runtime Registry / Discovery: no updates but Domain Registry bug was fixed and should be tested by Steffen (DT)
- Id Module: no updates
- Policy Engine: added error message when policies block messages delivery. File based persistency for the NodeJS Policy Engine. Not commited yet in the github
- RuntimeUA / Syncher: no updates
- Vertx MN: no updates
- Matrix MN: no updates
- NOdeJS MN: no updates
- Json Schema Validation: no updates
- Toolkit: no updates

**standardisation**

At the end we didn't manage to participate in W3C TPAC Lisbon.

W3C Community creation will be proposed

**paper**

Ricardo Pereira will propose a target conference.
