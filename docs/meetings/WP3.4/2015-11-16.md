### Minutes
* Address Factory: Implementation has been forked from https://github.com/jsdom/whatwg-url and will be integrated on dev-service-framework tomorrow.
* Syncher Manager: Initial implementation and test specification done. Works as it is now, but the functionality might change after internal discussions. Any update changes will be communicated.
* Message Factory: Initial implementation of base classes and factory has been implemented. Further implementation and test specifications are being done and should be ready by mid week.
* Catalogue Data Factory: Base classes have been implemented. Further factory functionalities and test specifications still to be implemented and tested by mid week.
* Identity Factory: Clarification on some class attributes and general understanding of the specification i needed from WP2. Arnaud to join the Idp Conference Call on Friday to clarify some of these issues.
* JSON Object vs JavaScript Classes: it was discussed and concluded to contnue using classes, but where applicable use existing Javascript objects (example: reTHINK List => JavaScript Array/Set Object, reTHINK Date => JavaScript Date, reTHINK ListElement => JavaScript Object)
* Validator Schema: http://geraintluff.github.io/tv4/ has been included as npm module, but tests still need to be made against reTHINK schemas. The validator will be used only for development.



### Action Points 
* Complete implementations, test specifications with karma and upload on dev repository (all)
* Specify next functionalities (Communication and Connection and Context Data models ?) for 2nd milestone to be discussed and synchronized with WP5 during Heidelberg Plenary
* Preparation for Heidelberg Plenary


####Next Conference Call
* 23rd November 2015 @12:00 CET. If i have no objections to this proposal, i will send a Calender entry mid week.
