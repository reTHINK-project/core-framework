### Agenda

 1. Design Pattern (ECMAScript 6 Modules?)
 1. Development Repository (template structure as defined in the [methodology](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/tree/master/docs/methodology))
 1. Language Support (Java, JavaScript ?)
 1. Data Models Factory specifications 
  1. [Message Data Object Factory](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/blob/master/docs/specs/service-framework/sf_message_factory.md) (**)

  4. [Connection Data Object Factory](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/blob/master/docs/specs/service-framework/sf_connection_factory.md)
  5. User Identity Data Object Factory (**) (Frédéric)
  6. Context Data Object Factory

  8. Hyperty Descriptor Data Object Factory (**) (Alice)
  9. Address Data Oject Factory (**) (Anton)
  10. Data Object Descriptor (**)
  11. Protocol Stub Descriptor (**) (Steffen)



### Attendance

* Paulo Chainho (PTIN)
* Alice (FOKUS)
* Frédéric Luart (APizee)
* Steffen (DT)
* Anton (Qoubis)

### Minutes
* ECMAScript 6 Modules approach would fit here in seperating code from each partner and keeping this modular
* Phase 1 implementation deliverable: Feb 2016
* Identitfied high priority tasks for phase 1. 
* Before this date there are multiple (milestones)[https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/milestones]. The first milestone is **13th November** to have a preliminary FUNCTIONAL version of the framework.
* Discussed the option to have a common repository (dev-commons) across all WPackages to collect functionality common to all such as MessageFactory and AddressFactory specifications implemented  in Java(used by MessageNode Developers) and JavaScript(used by Hyperty Developers).
* Other functionality that can be provided by service framework - suggestion from Paulo - W3C sensor API to be used for context aware use cases (Resources [W3C spec](https://w3c.github.io/sensors/),  [gitHub project](https://github.com/w3c/sensors))


### Action Points 
* Complete specification of high priority tasks. (All PTIN playing the observer-reporter role :-) )Deadline 30th October
* Exercise invovled in this task is extract Information on the consititute of Data Model in D2.2, extract Information from the dynamic views where applicable for the Data Model and specify a Module/Factory/Class for it with functionalities. (see and explicit example provided by Paulo for the Syncher [here](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/blob/master/docs/specs/service-framework/sf_syncher_factory.md))

#####Tasks (finish specification before 30th October)
* [Message Data Object Factory](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/blob/master/docs/specs/service-framework/sf_message_factory.md) (Alice)
* Address Data Oject Factory (Anton)
* [Syncher Factory](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/blob/master/docs/specs/service-framework/sf_syncher_factory.md) (Alice with help from Paulo)
* User Identity Data Object Factory (Frédéric)
* Hyperty Descriptor Data Object Factory (Alice)
* Protocol Stub Descriptor (Steffen)
