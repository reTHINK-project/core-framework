### Attendance

* Paulo Chainho (PTIN)
* Alice (FOKUS)
* Steffen (DT)


### Missing
* Frédéric Luart (APizee)
* Anton (Qoubis)

### Minutes
* preliminary version of Synher Manager specification is complete and ready to be implemented
* preliminary version of address factory is complete and ready to be implemented
* preliminary version of message factory needs to sync again with changes made is WP2 and subsequently ready to be implemented
* Hyperty Descriptor and Proto Stub Factories will be moved to one module called CatalogueDataObject were the parent class (CatalogueData) and subclasses (Hyperty Descriptors,Protocol Stub Descriptors,Hyperty Policy Enforcer Descriptors,Hyperty Runtime Descriptors and Data Object Schemas) will be implemented.
* All implementations will be pushed to the [development repository] (https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-service-framework)
* Also in discussion was to find an agile procedure of working between specification from WP2 and implementation on WP3. Means to automate changes on JSON schemas to be refelceted on implementations without huge efforts. Mechanisms for this needs to be investigated. 
* General project methodology also was discussed. The proposed versioning and deployment of source code on the repository still needs to be addressed across WP3, WP4 and WP5. Proposal to the master branch and dev branch per feature. After the feature branch has been completely implemented and testing, then it can be merged to the master branch again. 

### Action Points 
* Start implementation of ready-to-go specifications (Qoubis, PTIN, FOKUS, DT)
* Finish specification of Identity factory (Apizee)

####Next Conference Call
* 16th November 2015 @12:00 CET. If i have no objections to this proposal, i will send a Calender entry mid next week.
