Summary
-------

**D3.5 and Phase 2 specs**

Since in the board meeting it was decided to delay D3.5 submission for 2 months, the new deadline for contributions is end of October.

Updates on specifications should be done in the new [specs repo](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs). In the [word doc](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/blob/master/docs/deliverables/d3.5/D3.5-Hyperty-Runtime-and-Hyperty-Messaging-Node-Specification.docx) people should provide the links to the markdown files to be imported from the specs repo. The editor (Paulo) will use existing scripts to automatically import these files into the word doc as soon as contributions are frozen and ready for internal review.

Recommendations for the implementation of the Message Nodes should be provided [here](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/blob/master/tutorials/msg-node-development-recommendations.md) and this link should be provided in the right section of the word doc version.

The specification tests should also be moved to the new repo spec: in a new "tests" folder?

Initial contributions for the Messaging Framework, Runtime, P2P Stubs, Group Communication and Policy Management.

In a dedicated telco organised to discuss the QoS contribution, it was agreed to provide a initial version of this specification. The final version will be provided in D3.4.

There will be a telco dedicated to discuss in more detail group Communication this afternoon (8th sept) at 15:30 CET, notably Identity Management aspects in the NodeJS Runtime.

**development status**

* NodeJS Runtime: no updates. Still pending clarification about the distribution of bundles namely the usage of npm install instead of the catalogue. APIZEE will provide more info in the github issue
- Graph Connector / Global Registry: TUB didn't attend.
- Runtime Registry / Discovery: no updates
- Id Module: no updates
- Policy Engine: no updates.
- RuntimeUA / Syncher: no updates
- Vertx MN: no updates
- Matrix MN: no updates
- NOdeJS MN: removed implicit subscription of allocated addresses
- Json Schema Validation: no updates
  - the toolchain provided to verify Json schema is available and running.
  - The issues discovered with the Json schema do not relate to the "verification tool" but to the tool chain used initially in the project to automatically generate code, see:
      - https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-service-framework/issues/42
      - https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-service-framework/issues/41
      - which both reaffirm an old issue discussed in 2015: https://github.com/reTHINK-project/architecture/issues/60
    json-schemas that are not generated correctly from the plantuml, should be edited manually
- Toolkit: no updates

**standardisation**

At the end we managed to register a booth for TPAC Lisbon but only W3C members can attend. This is not aligned with what was told to us in a call with W3C representatives back in July. If this constraint is confirmed we'll give up on this participation.

**paper**

It is proposed to write a paper for ICIN'17 but Ricardo Pereira commented we should look for another conference (if possible with higher level of recognition in the academic world) since this is mainly the only conference where the project has submitted papers.
