Summary
-------

**[D3.2](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/labels/D3.2)**

Initial versions for [starting dev documentation](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-service-framework/blob/develop/docs/manuals/hyperty.md). Focus should now be on Hyperty development, app and messaging node documentation. Almost complete documentation for Matrix, Browser Runtime and Standalone App Runtime. All D3.2 contributions must be provided until 3rd Feb, lunchtime.

**Nodejs MsgNode**

NodeJS protostub is now deployable in the Runtime. Missing Registry server integration and having the Connector example running. As soon as these steps are performed a dedicated session for interoperability between NodeJS, Vertx and Matrix will be schedulled.

**Vertx MsgNode**

Very close to be released 0.3.

**Matrix MsgNode**

The Hyperty Connector demo is running in Matrix, and an integration session dedicated to interoperability is scheduled for this afternoon.

**Core Runtime 0.3 and Service Framework**

-	[Runtime Catalogue (FOKUS)](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/3): closed. It should also support DataObjectSchemas. To be validated.
-	Separation of the Idp Proxy from Id Module. No progress
-	Graph Connector: TUB didn't attend
-	Synch Manager and Syncher: initial version for DataObjectChild. An Hyperty Group Chat example using this new version will be provided very soon.
-	[New Data Model Package Structure](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-service-framework/issues/16) is approved by Alice to solve cross-referencing issues in the json-schema. Next steps are to generate a new version of the json-schema with this structure (Micael) and implement the validation (Alice)
-	MessageFactory is progressing and an updated version should be provided today.
-	a new URLFactory was released by Quobis. Not tested yet.
-	probably the usage of these factories in components will be moved to 0.4
-	No progress with Policy Engine and Id Module. To be moved to 0.4.

**Core Runtime 0.4**

-	Generic Persistence Manager component (Quobis): progressing well. Marc raised an issue about how to keep the runtime catalogue synched with catalogue server without having to retrieve the data object from the server. To be discussed offline.

**Browser Runtime**

Initial version was released without the Hyperty Connector example since there is still a directy dependency on the Runtime Registry to be removed by INESC. Standalone Android and iOS Runtime are ongoing and should be published in a separated repo.

**[Runtime Administration](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/issues/160)**

No feedback provided yet.

**[LWM2M Integration](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/issues/159)**

FOKUS is evaluating the integration of LWM2M with Nodejs Runtime.

### Pending Issues from previous meetings that were not discussed

**Runtime shared by more than one App**

Currently, and due to technical browser limitations, there is one runtime per App. Solutions to support more than one App per Runtime are [under discussion](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/issues/137).
