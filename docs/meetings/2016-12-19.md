Summary
-------


**Phase 2 specs**

Only minor adjustments done according to feedback got from the implementation tasks. A Databackup service spec will be proposed in the next days.

**NodeJS Phase 2 implementation**

- Retrieve Catalogue Objects according to constraints: should be ready.
- [IDM @ NodeJS](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/issues/17): see [outcome here](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/issues/17#issuecomment-261919199)
- Reporter not supported by last node versions. Using older versions don't work. Other solutions have to be found. Jamal (APIZEE), Vitor (ALB)
- Issues with Storage Manager: fixed
- [Runtime Capabilities issue is back again](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/131): Fixed

**Address Reusage**

Almost finished. ALB is adjusting the arch in order to facilitate the support of address reusage from remote Runtimes used by the same user.

**Runtime Sharing**

Quobis has finished the implementation. Now pending on INESC and ALB to adapt othe runtime components to use it.


**Global Discovery**

- Global Registry / Graph Connector : Integration of the Graph Connector in the runtime core is almost finished.
- Global Discovery: two options to interact with the Domain Registry:
  1- Using the Rest API: not protocol agnostic but easier to implement. Only Read operations will be allowed. Domain Registry API has to be accessible from the Internet.
  2- Using "message API" that is agnostic of Domain Registry Rest API. A Message Stub featuring Protofly mechanisms ie Protostubs loader [will be provided](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/issues/20): Steffen already succeed having something working but having problems deploying the nodejs enabled Stub. Vitor will provide some insights on how to do that with the toolkit.
- MSG Node Access Control: can we use the Id Token? According to feedback from WP4 (thx JM), yes, but some work should be required from the Policy Engine. Waiting feedback from Policy framework partners (INESC, IMT)
- No progress on the discussion about using IdP Identifiers to query the Global Registry

**Legacy INtewroking**

- Extensions required in the Runtime Core to support legacy interworking, are done.
- IMS interworking: more detailed specs ongoing


**P2P Protostubs**

- Extensions required are progressing well. Should be ready very soon,
- P2P Stubs based on WebRTC Data Channel ready.

**Others**

- Login popup is not opening in Firefox: David has fixed some issues on the browser runtime but still persists a problem on the IDM. Tiago will have a look on it.

**standardisation**

*no progress*

W3C Community creation will be proposed. DT (Ingo) could help in order to find the right scope.
IETF for Decentralized Messaging Framework was also discussed.


**papers**

*no progress*

Initial input will have to be summarised and adapted.
