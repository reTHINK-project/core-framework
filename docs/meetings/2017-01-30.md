Summary
-------

**NodeJS Phase 2 implementation**

- Retrieve Catalogue Objects according to constraints: should be ready. but Vitor is facing some problems
- [IDM @ NodeJS](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/issues/17): see [outcome here](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/issues/17#issuecomment-261919199). Mutual authentication is not working since WebCrypto API is not support in NodeJS. A polyfill should be tested. In the meanwhile Mutual Authentication is disabled when nodejs peers are involved.

**Address Reusage**

Merge into develop was done.

**Runtime Sharing**

Quobis has finished the implementation. Now pending on INESC and ALB to adapt other runtime components to use it.
Ongoing discussion about how to sync internal and external minibus about the channel id to be used for the communication between both

**Global Discovery**
(no progress)
- Adaptation of the discovery lib: no progress (INESC)
- Global Registry / Graph Connector : Integration of the Graph Connector in the runtime core is almost finished.
- Global Discovery: two options to interact with the Domain Registry:
  1- Using the Rest API: not protocol agnostic but easier to implement. Only Read operations will be allowed. Domain Registry API has to be accessible from the Internet.
  2- Using "message API" that is agnostic of Domain Registry Rest API. A Message Stub featuring Protofly mechanisms ie Protostubs loader [will be provided](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/specs/issues/20): Steffen already succeed having something working but having problems deploying the nodejs enabled Stub. Vitor will provide some insights on how to do that with the toolkit.
- MSG Node Access Control: can we use the Id Token? According to feedback from WP4 (thx JM), yes, but some work should be required from the Policy Engine. Waiting feedback from Policy framework partners (INESC, IMT)
- It seems the usage of IdP Identifiers to query the Global Registry are not possible due to the short time validation of the tokens

**Legacy INtewroking**

- Some issues fixed in the Runtime Core to support legacy interworking.
- Slack IWProtostin is ongoing
- IMS interworking: ongoing

**P2P Protostubs**

- Specs updated to be implemented in the P2P Stubs.
- integration tests were schedulled for this week

**Others**

No progress.

**standardisation**

[Ongoing work for the W3C Community creation](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/tree/master/docs/standards/W3C). Comments and contributions are welcome,

DT (Ingo) could help in order to find the right scope.
IETF for Decentralized Messaging Framework was also discussed.

**papers**

*no progress*

Initial input will have to be summarised and adapted.
