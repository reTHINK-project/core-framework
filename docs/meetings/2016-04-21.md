Summary
-------

Due to Easter Holidays, WP3 Phase 1 developments will be delayed until mid April.

**Browser Runtime**

A physical meeting was held in Aveiro with Quobis and PT Inovação last Monday (14th March) to speed-up the implementation of the Browser Runtime. Lots of progress including having the demos running in the Browser Runtime. A new Browser Runtime has been released. There is still a mismatch between the Runtime Core and the Browser Runtime loader to be fixed asap.

**Matrix MsgNode**

We have successfully tested interoperability between Matrix and Vertx domains for WebRTC Connector demo. A design issue in the Group Chat (routing path setup was missing between the Reporter Msg Node and the Observer Runtime). The spec was already updated and it was agreed to take this opportunity to implement the new Message spec for the management of routing paths at the Message Node.

**Nodejs MsgNode**

Good news: Webrtc and group chat demos working in NodeJS.

**Core Runtime 0.4**

-	Separation of the Idp Proxy from Id Module. This is delayed but should be finished very soon
-	Graph Connector: not much progress.
- Policy Engine: The usage of this new version should be integrated in the current webrtc and chat demos. Rules to enforce Reporter - Observer will also be implemented by the policy engine.
- Runtime Registry: not much progress on [keep alive and more advanced search features](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-runtime-core/issues/69). [On going discussion](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-registry-domain/issues/8).
- Sync Manager improvement should be finished.
-	URL and Address Factories are only being used by the Runtime Registry.
-	It seems Generic Persistence Manager component is already being used by the runtime Catalogue (Fokus didn't attend) but not by others.



**Service Framework 0.2**

-	Generation from plantuml of a new version of the json-schema with new structure is ongoing. A [few issues](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-service-framework/issues/22#issuecomment-199224873) related with mismatch between resource tree oriented json-schema and object oriented plantuml.
- Message Factory update and	json schema validation: Alice will confirm the status of this
-	User Identity Factory: not discussed.

**NodeJS Runtime**

No progress.

**[Runtime Administration](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/issues/160)**

It was Agreed to have it as a GUI of the Browser Runtime. Antón from Quobis will lead this task to ensure a consistent layout between the different types of settings.


### Pending Issues from previous meetings that were not discussed

**Runtime shared by more than one App**

Currently, and due to technical browser limitations, there is one runtime per App. Solutions to support more than one App per Runtime are [under discussion](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/issues/137).
