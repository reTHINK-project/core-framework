Summary
-------

The usage of "catalogue".<domain> is not prepared in some Testbeds. This rule should be revisited in phase 2.

**Browser Runtime/Standalone App**

Fixed some issues regarding the runtime installation taking into account the different operation modes (dev and prod). Should be ready to be integrated in the toolkit.

**NodeJS Runtime**

In progress. Issue about user interaction required for authentication. To be further discussed this afternoon.

**[Runtime Administration](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/issues/160)**

On going 

**Core Runtime 0.5**

-	Integration of Orange Idd Proxy in Id Module. Some issues to be discussed with Orange. Partners are encouraged to use Slack in order to progress as much as possible.
-	Graph Connector: Felix was sick and dedicated session was not held. No further news
- Policy Engine: The usage of this new version should be integrated in the current webrtc and chat demos.
- Runtime Registry: missing persistency and more advanced searches.

**Service Framework 0.3**

-	Generation from plantuml of a new version of the json-schema with new structure is ongoing. A [few issues](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-service-framework/issues/22#issuecomment-199224873) related with mismatch between resource tree oriented json-schema and object oriented plantuml.
- Message Factory update and	json schema validation: Alice will confirm the status of this
-	User Identity Factory: not discussed.




### Pending Issues from previous meetings that were not discussed

**Runtime shared by more than one App**

Currently, and due to technical browser limitations, there is one runtime per App. Solutions to support more than one App per Runtime are [under discussion](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/issues/137).
