Summary
-------

Next telco will be on the 25th of August.

**[Phase 2 topics](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/issues/170)**

"Protofly at MN" was confirmed by DT

**D3.1.2**

No objections to D3.1.2 ToC and editorial responsabilities assigned to main section. As previously agreed, contributions are due to 9th September. Specs for the new features should be provided in Github MD files [here](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-service-framework/tree/master/docs/specs).

**Phase 2 specs**

* P2P protostub: approach briefly explained by Paulo. David commented having the protostub deployed in iFrame shouldn't be a problem but we should take into account whether we want protostub instances shared among different window contexts by using eg Shared Workers or Service Workers.
* Runtime instance shared among different windows was briefly discussed. David commented the usage of Shared and Service Workers should be further researched and experimented, but conceptually they should be feasible.
* Multiparty Connections was briefly discussed. APIZEE should be more interested in star topologies but ALB is also interested in full meshed topologies for small number of participants eg 3 party calls. Discussion will go on offline in the issue.
* Interworking with legacy : no further Discussion
* QoS : no discussion

**development status**

A new version of the core runtime and dev service framework should be released by end of July.

* NodeJS Runtime is almost ready. Hyperty deployment is almost done.
- Graph Connector / Global Registry: Felix merged with runtime core develop branch and no conflict was detected. The big size issue was not addressed yet. Felix will provide a picture to discuss the integration of the Graph Connector with other runtime components.
- Policy engine is being improved in order to facilitate the introduction of new features.

**standardisation**

No further progress.

**paper**

No progress.
