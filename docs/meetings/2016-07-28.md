Summary
-------

**[Phase 2 topics](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/issues/170)**

"Protofly at MN" was confirmed by DT

**D3.1.2**

No objections to D3.1.2 ToC and editorial responsabilities assigned to main section. As previously agreed, contributions are due to 9th September.

**Phase 2 specs**

* P2P protostub: approach briefly explained by Paulo. David commented having the protostub deployed in iFrame shouldn't be a problem but we should take into account whether we want protostub instances shared among different window contexts by using eg Shared Workers or Service Workers.
* Runtime instance shared among different windows was briefly discussed. David commented the usage of Shared and Service Workers should be further researched and experimented, but conceptually they should be feasible.
* Multiparty Connections was briefly discussed. APIZEE should be more interested in star topologies but ALB is also interested in full meshed topologies for small number of participants eg 3 party calls. Discussion will go on offline in the issue.
* Interworking with legacy : no further Discussion
* QoS : no discussion

**development status**

A new version of the core runtime and dev service framework should be released by end of July.

* NodeJS Runtime is almost ready. Hyperty deployment is almost done.
- Graph Connector / Global Registry: Felix merged with runtime core develop branch and no conflict was detected. The big size issue was not addressed yet. Felix will provide a picture to discuss the integration of the Graph Connector with other runtime components.
- Policy engine is being improved in order to facilitate the introduction of new features.

**standardisation**

No further progress.

**paper**

No progress.
