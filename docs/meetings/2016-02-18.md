Summary
-------

**[D3.2](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/labels/D3.2)**

Documentation is almost complete. Main tasks to be complete are Hyperty and App development. First word doc version should be provided tomorrow.

**Nodejs MsgNode**

Not much progress. This is now really delayed and APIZEE should now make a big effort to have it in time for phase 1.

**Vertx MsgNode**

A few adjustments to support data sync child.

**Matrix MsgNode**

Some issues identified in the workshop session last week were fixed. The Subscription Manager required for the new Syncher is ongoing. A new workshop session is schedulled for next Thursday at 15:00 CET.

**Core Runtime 0.3 and Service Framework**

-	Runtime Catalogue (FOKUS): missing operation to retrieve json schema. This is blocking the DataSyncChild implementation.
-	Some components (Runtime Catalogue, Registry and Catalogue local) are using DOM functions that won't be available in NodeJS. This has to be fixed asap eg using a facade like what was done with the sandbox.
-	Separation of the Idp Proxy from Id Module. No progress
-	Graph Connector: TUB didn't attend
-	Synch Manager and Syncher: blocked by Runtime Catalogue (see above). An Hyperty Group Chat example implementation as started.
-	MessageFactory is now closed.
-	URLFactory was not tested yet.
-	new hypertyDiscovery lib was released but not fully tested yet. As soon as this is closed, the initial Service Framework can be released.
-	No progress on User Identity Factory. APIZEE will clarify on this offline.

**Core Runtime 0.4**

-	Generate of a new version of the json-schema with new structure (Micael) was not done yet.
-	json schema validation has not started(Alice)
-	Generic Persistence Manager component (Quobis): was released. Other components like runtime Catalogue can start using it.
-	No progress with Policy Engine and Id Module.

**Browser Runtime**

Browser Runtime is evolving according to core 0.3. Standalone Android and iOS Runtime are ongoing and should be published in a separated repo.

**NodeJS Runtime**

No progress. A special session is schdulled for tomorrow at 15:00

**[Runtime Administration](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/issues/160)**

Some discussion about having a special Admin Hyperty. To be further discussed in the Issue.

**[LWM2M Integration](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/issues/159)**

FOKUS agreed to use the Nodejs Runtime. Specification should be published very soon, hoperfully still in time for D3.2

### Pending Issues from previous meetings that were not discussed

**Runtime shared by more than one App**

Currently, and due to technical browser limitations, there is one runtime per App. Solutions to support more than one App per Runtime are [under discussion](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/issues/137).
