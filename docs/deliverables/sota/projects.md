## Projects

The WONDER project has enlightened some foundations 
paths to be followed in a post-IMS era dominated by Web technologies that reTHINK is currently exploiting. Notably, the novel Signalling On-the-fly (SigOfly) concept was conceived and successfully demonstrated to enable seamless interoperability between different WebRTC service domains. reTHINK Protocol On-the-fly concept extends WONDER, the Signalling On-the-fly concept to any other service domain where needed protocol stacks can be executed in a Web Runtime. 

The WONDER Library used to validate SigOfly concept can be used in reTHINK as a good starting point to design and implement reTHINK runtime APIs and reTHINK Javascript framework.
