## Runtime Node Requirements
<p>**The effort to introduce new capabilities in the runtime should be reasonable**</p> The effort to introduce new capabilities in the runtime should be reasonable, for example:

- missing WebRTC features eg Identity
- Protocol on the fly mechanism
- Policy Enforcement Points
- Hyperty Registry


<p>**The Runtime must be secured**</p> The runtime must support the execution of entrusted code in isolated sandboxes. It should be possible to take advantage of existing secured elements like SIM cards or embedded SIM 





<p>**The Runtime must have a good performance**</p> The Runtime must have a good performance


<p>**The Runtime should support Standardised Messaging Notifications**</p> The Runtime should support standardised W3C [Push Messaging](http://www.w3.org/TR/push-api/) which allows applications to receive messages sent by servers regardless whether the Application is currently active. Useful to support notifications about incoming WebRTC calls.


<p>**The Runtime should support Web Socket**</p> The Runtime should support [Web Socket](http://www.w3.org/TR/websockets/).


<p>**The runtime must support standard Javascript (ECMAScript)**</p> The runtime must support standard at least [ECMAScript version 5](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/ ) (Javascript).


<p>**The Runtime should support W3C WebRTC APIs**</p> The Runtime should support W3C WebRTC APIs including:

* [Media Capture and Streams API](http://www.w3.org/TR/mediacapture-streams/)
* [WebRTC](http://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/ )


<p>**The Runtime should be deployable in the most used Devices and Operating Systems**</p> The Runtime should be deployable in the most used Devices and Operating Systems, including:

* Android (Smartphone and Tablet) 
* iOS (Smartphone and Tablet)
* Raspberry PI
* Linux 
* Windows
