## Runtime Node Requirements
- **The effort to introduce new capabilities in the runtime should be reasonable:**  for example:

 - missing WebRTC features eg Identity
 - Protocol on the fly mechanism
 - Policy Enforcement Points
 - Hyperty Registry


- **The Runtime must be secured:** The runtime must support the execution of entrusted code in isolated sandboxes. It should be possible to take advantage of existing secured elements like SIM cards or embedded SIM 





- **The Runtime should support Standardised Messaging Notifications:** The Runtime should support standardised W3C [Push Messaging](http://www.w3.org/TR/push-api/) which allows applications to receive messages sent by servers regardless whether the Application is currently active. Useful to support notifications about incoming WebRTC calls.


- **The Runtime should support Web Socket:** 


- **The runtime must support standard Javascript (ECMAScript):** at least [ECMAScript version 5](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/ ) (Javascript).


- **The Runtime should support W3C WebRTC APIs:**  including:

 * [Media Capture and Streams API](http://www.w3.org/TR/mediacapture-streams/)
 * [WebRTC](http://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/ )


- **The Runtime should be deployable in the most used Devices and Operating Systems:**  including:

 * Android (Smartphone and Tablet) 
 * iOS (Smartphone and Tablet)
 * Raspberry PI
 * Linux 
 * Windows
