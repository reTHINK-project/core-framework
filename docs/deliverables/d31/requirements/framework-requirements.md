<h2>Service Framework  Requirements</h2><p></p>**Framework must be agnostic of the Messaging Node used** :</br> <br/>**The Service Framework MUST avoid any JS conflict** :</br> The hyperty has to be self contained, if we add a framework as angular (for example) we may have conflict if an existing angular is already in the site (or another framework - I have some experience for instance on Jquery conflict with Prototype ... )

Do we need a framework as angular as we will not have any graphical user interface in the hyperty framework ?<br/>**Service Framework MUST be Modular in nature** :</br> Development of modules on the Framework should be loosely coupled, self contained and re-usable by other libraries/modules   <br/>**The Service Framework MUST be open source** :</br> No proprietary solution as the project itself demands all components be open source.<br/>**Service Framework should be Supported in all Devices and Operating Systems featuring Hyperty Runtime** :</br> See devices and operating systems defined at #1 <br/>**Service Framework MUST be light weight and fast** :</br> The service framework size is important as latency plays an important role and we don't want heavy frameworks that adds overhead to the overall performance in executing the hyperties <br/>**Service Framework SHOULD support Model-View-Controller design pattern** :</br> Model-View-Controller approach: enables easier maintainability and clarity

*View:* The view presents data to users through format & layout. The view is rendered by the model
*Model:* The model handles data & business logic. It also allows for clear separation between the presentation (View) and application logic
*Controller:* Receives user requests and calls back to the model to select a proper view. Uses HTTP GET or POST request to manage the data<br/>
