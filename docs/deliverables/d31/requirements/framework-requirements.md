| **Requirement Name** | **Description** | <br/> | --- | --- |<br/>Framework must be agnostic of the Messaging Node used | <br/>The Service Framework MUST avoid any JS conflict | The hyperty has to be self contained, if we add a framework as angular (for example) we may have conflict if an existing angular is already in the site (or another framework - I have some experience for instance on Jquery conflict with Prototype ... )

Do we need a framework as angular as we will not have any graphical user interface in the hyperty framework ?<br/>Service Framework MUST be Modular in nature | Development of modules on the Framework should be loosely coupled, self contained and re-usable by other libraries/modules   <br/>The Service Framework MUST be open source | No proprietary solution as the project itself demands all components be open source.<br/>Service Framework should be Supported in all Devices and Operating Systems featuring Hyperty Runtime | See devices and operating systems defined at #1 <br/>Service Framework MUST be light weight and fast | The service framework size is important as latency plays an important role and we don't want heavy frameworks that adds overhead to the overall performance in executing the hyperties <br/>Service Framework SHOULD support Model-View-Controller design pattern | Model-View-Controller approach: enables easier maintainability and clarity

*View:* The view presents data to users through format & layout. The view is rendered by the model
*Model:* The model handles data & business logic. It also allows for clear separation between the presentation (View) and application logic
*Controller:* Receives user requests and calls back to the model to select a proper view. Uses HTTP GET or POST request to manage the data<br/>
