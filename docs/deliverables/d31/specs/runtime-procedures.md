Runtime Main Procedures
-----------------------

This section describes in detail the Runtime Main procedures by using UML Message Sequence Charts. They correspond to the dynamic view of the Hyperty Runtime and they validate the static design for the most important use cases that were already used in D2.1 and originally described in D1.1.

The presented data flows, use the Hyperty Runtime APIs, as much as possible, in the messages signature in order to validate the Runtime design. The detailed definition of messages exchanged among Hyperties and protocol stubs, as defined in D2.2 Message Model, are also used when appropriate.
