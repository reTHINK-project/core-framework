## Runtime Main Procedures

This section describes in detail the Runtime Main procedures by using UML Message Sequence Charts. They correspond to the dynamic view of the Hyperty Runtime and they validate the static design for the most important use cases that were already used in WP2 and originaly described in WP1.

The previsouly defined APIs are used as much as possible in the messages signature in order to validate the Runtime design. The detailed definition of messages exchanged among Hyperties and protocol stubs, as defined in D2.2 Message Model, are also used when appropriate.
