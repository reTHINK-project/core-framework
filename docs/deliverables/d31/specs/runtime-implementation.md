## Runtime Implementation Considerations

In this section, some implementation considerations are presented for the different types of runtime platforms that are the target of the Hyperty Runtime specification namely the browser runtime, standalone runtime applications and M2M standalone runtime to be installed in devices with more constrained capabilities. These considerations are mainly about the implementation of the runtime sandboxing solution since all other core runtime components will be shared and common in all target platforms.
