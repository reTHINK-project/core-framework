This section, describes in detail the Basic Runtime procedures that are required to support the deployment and operation of Hyperties in the Hyperty Runtime. It includes:

-	Deployment of protocol stubs
-	Deployment of Hyperties
-	Generic procedure to route messages
-	Four different Hyperty communication situations namely:
	-	local communication between Hyperties from the same domain (running in the same Sandbox)

	-	Remote communication between Hyperties from the same domain
	-	Remote communication between Hyperties from different domains
