State of the Art and Procurement
================================

In this chapter, a summary of the exhaustive work performed in terms of research of state of the art and procurement of open source solutions to be used in the implementation phase, is provided.

This State of the Art, complements the general architecture State of the Art and goes deeper in domains addressed by core framework implementation, namely:

-	Security in Web Runtime.
-	Standards that WP3 should comply with, notably W3C APIs and IETF Protocols.
-	Web Runtime solutions including JavaScript runtime and WebRTC implementations.
-	Real Time Messaging solutions including Node.js and Vertx.
-	Partners' Assets that can be leveraged or integrated with reTHINK testbeds including Quobis [104] and APIZEE [103] products as well as the open source WONDER library [36] prototyped by PTIN and DT in the scope of WONDER project [32].

A detailed report of state of the art and procurement for Standards, Messaging, Runtime, QoS, Projects and Web Frameworks is provided in Annex A.
