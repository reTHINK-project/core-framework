Conclusions
===========

This report provided a detailed specification of reTHINK Core Framework that comprises the Hyperty Runtime, where Hyperties are executed and the Messaging Node, which supports the messaging communication among Hyperty instances running in different devices.

The current specification aims to promote a rapid and iterative prototyping of reTHINK Core Framework with optimised usage of resources, in order to provide in time, the required components to start the implementation of scenarios in WP5.

This approach, positions reTHINK prototypes at the forefront of technology with its new functionalities, optimising the usage of resources and complying with reTHINK ambitious milestone time line.
