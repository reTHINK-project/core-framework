Messaging Node Specification
----------------------------

This Chapter contains the functional design of the Messaging Node Architecture which enables messaging communication among Hyperty instances running in different Runtime devices.

Since the protocol-on-the fly concept is used together with the message model defined in D2.2, it is not required to specify in detail the Messaging Node APIs to guarantee interoperability between different domains. Instead, a more detailed specification is provided for each messaging solution selected during the procurement activity namely for Vertx.io, Node.js and Matrix.
