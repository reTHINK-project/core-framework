# 1. State of the art of Apizee Solution
## 1.1. What is ApiRTC?

ApiRTC solution includes a communication platform and a client JavaScript library that can be used by developpers to developped their applications.

For Rethink, Apizee propose the usage of apiRTC Community Edition (Open source version : LGPL). This version is not yet published and documented.



## Asset Evaluation

### Overview

*Overview of functionalities and type of WP3 component that the asset can be used for ie Messaging Node, Runtime, Network QoS and Framework*

Messaging Node :
Runtime :
Network Qos : Possibility to get browser QoS Statistics
Framework


### Architecture

*Main functional modules and interfaces. Should be based on a picture*

### APIs

ApiRTC provides a complete set of API for developers

### Requirements Analysis

*Analyse how the solution fullfills [WP3 requirements](selection-criteria.md) according to Component Type addressed by the solution ie Messaging Node, Runtime, Network QoS or Framework*
*The fullfillment of each requirement should be analysed and if needed validated with some tests. Code snippets or other means like configuration data should be provided to clearly demonstrate the requirement fullfilment.
In case the Requirement is not fulfilled, possible solutions should be proposed including effort estimation.*


Tasks to be done during Project :

Publish and document apiRTC CE

Specifictaion regle utilisation des diffrent connectoeurs / routage des appesl
    


Add Redis Cluster
Add Connector to QoS Server + Managenement on apiRTC Client to manage connection to TURN Servers
Add Connector to Identity Manager
Add Connector to other Communication Platform (Protocol On the Fly)
Add Connector to Kurento Server
Add Connector to different Vendor WebRTC GW
