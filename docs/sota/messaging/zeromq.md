## ZeroMQ Evaluation

### Overview

In the scope of the reTHINK project ZeroMQ is a candidate technology for the Messaging Node.

It is a  high-performance, low level, asynchronous messaging library originally written in C++, that now has multiple native Implementations.
It is used as a thin layer between the application and transport layers.

##### Highlights:

* Connect your code in any language, on any platform. 40+ Language Bindings
* Carries messages across inproc, IPC, TCP, TIPC, multicast.
* Smart patterns like pub-sub, push-pull, and router-dealer can be combined together to form powerful architectures.
* High-speed asynchronous I/O engines, in a tiny library ((20k lines of C++)).
* Backed by a large and active open source community.
* Supports every modern language and platform.
* Any architecture: centralized, distributed, small, or large.
* Multicore Optimized
* Automatic TCP (re)connect
* Fast: 8M msg/sec, usec latency
* Faster than TCP, for clustered products and supercomputing
* Fast for development thanks to many useful abstraction layers, native languages, bindings and huge open source community.


### Architecture
The following figure represents the six basic types of communication patterns that ZeroMQ supports.

#### Built-in core ZeroMQ patterns
* Request-reply: connects a set of clients to a set of services. This is a remote procedure call and task distribution pattern.
* Pub-sub: connects a set of publishers to a set of subscribers. This is a data distribution pattern.
* Pipeline: connects nodes in a fan-out/fan-in pattern that can have multiple steps and loops. This is a parallel task distribution and collection pattern.
* Exclusive pair: connects two sockets exclusively. This is a pattern for connecting two threads in a process, not to be confused with "normal" pairs of sockets.

On top of the built-in core ZeroMQ patterns high-level messaging patterns are defined [here](http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all). They are not part of the core library, do not come with the ZeroMQ package, and exist in their own space as part of the ZeroMQ community. For example the Majordomo pattern ([Reliable Request-Reply Patterns](http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all#reliable-request-reply)), sits in the GitHub Majordomo project in the ZeroMQ organization.
One of the things that ZeroMQ also aims to provide is a set of high-level patterns, both small (how to handle messages sanely) and large (how to make a reliable pub-sub architecture).


These can be used as "fabric" to make very powerful architectures. The next image shows an example of this modularity. [A pub/sub multi-cluster Architecture](http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all#Scaling-to-Multiple-Clusters)
