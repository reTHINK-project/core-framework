## MQTT Evaluation

MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is a lightweight broker-based publish/subscribe messaging protocol designed to be open, simple, lightweight and easy to implement. These characteristics make it ideal for use in constrained environments such as machine-to-machine (M2M)/"Internet of Things" connectivity scenarios.

MQTT-SN (MQTT for Sensor Networks) is a variation of the main protocol aimed at embedded devices on non-TCP/IP networks, such as ZigBee.

### Overview

In the scope of the reTHINK project, MQTT is a candidate technology for the Messaging Node.


#### Highlights:

MQTT was designed for low-bandwidth, high latency networks in the late 1990s/early 2000s. As a result, the designers made a number of key choices which influenced the way it "looks and feels".

 *  Simplicity, simplicity, simplicity! Don't add too many "bells and whistles" but provide a solid building block which can easily be integrated into other solutions. Be simple to implement.
 *  Publish/subscribe messaging. Useful for most sensor applications, and enables devices to come online and publish "stuff" that hasn't been previously known about or predefined.
 *  Zero administration (or as close as possible). Behave sensibly in response to unexpected actions and enable applications to "just work", e.g. by dynamically creating topics when needed.
 *  Minimise the on-the-wire footprint. Add an absolute minimum of data overhead to any message. Be lightweight and bandwidth efficient.
 *  Expect and cater for frequent network disruption (for low bandwidth, high latency, unreliable, high cost-to-run networks)... -> [Last Will and Testament](http://www.hivemq.com/mqtt-essentials-part-9-last-will-and-testament/)
 *  Continuous session awareness -> [Last Will and Testament](http://www.hivemq.com/mqtt-essentials-part-9-last-will-and-testament/)
 *  Expect that client applications may have very limited processing resources available. 
 *  Provide traditional messaging qualities of service where the environment allows. Provide "quality of service" 
 *  Data agnostic. Don't mandate content formats, remain flexible.


## Architecture


MQTT has a client/server model, where every node is a client that connects to a server, know as a broker, over TCP.
MQTT is message oriented. Messages are published to a topic.
Clients may subscribe to multiple topics or use a wildcard matching based subscription.

MQTT supports three quality of service levels, "Fire and forget", "delivered at least once" (QoS1) and "delivered exactly once" (QoS2).
