## XMPP Evaluation


From http://xmpp.org/:

> The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is an open technology for real-time communication, which powers a wide range of applications including instant messaging, presence, multi-party chat, voice and video calls, collaboration, lightweight middleware, content syndication, and generalized routing of XML data. 



### Overview

In the scope of the reTHINK project XMPP is a candidate technology for the Messaging Node.


##### Highlights:

* **Open** - the XMPP protocols are free, open, public, and easily understandable; in addition, multiple implementations exist in the form clients, servers, server components, and code libraries.

* **Standard** - the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has formalized the core XML streaming protocols as an approved instant messaging and presence technology. The XMPP specifications were published as RFC 3920 and RFC 3921 in 2004, and the XMPP Standards Foundation continues to publish many XMPP Extension Protocols. In 2011 the core RFCs were revised, resulting in the most up-to-date specifications (RFC 6120, RFC 6121, and RFC 6122).

* **Proven** - the first Jabber/XMPP technologies were developed by Jeremie Miller in 1998 and are now quite stable; hundreds of developers are working on these technologies, there are tens of thousands of XMPP servers running on the Internet today, and millions of people use XMPP for instant messaging through public services such as Google Talk and XMPP deployments at organizations worldwide.

* **Decentralized** - the architecture of the XMPP network is similar to email; as a result, anyone can run their own XMPP server, enabling individuals and organizations to take control of their communications experience.

* **Secure** - any XMPP server may be isolated from the public network (e.g., on a company intranet) and robust security using SASL and TLS has been built into the core XMPP specifications. In addition, the XMPP developer community is actively working on end-to-end encryption to raise the security bar even further.

* **Extensible** - using the power of XML, anyone can build custom functionality on top of the core protocols; to maintain interoperability, common extensions are published in the XEP series, but such publication is not required and organizations can maintain their own private extensions if so desired.

* **Flexible** - XMPP applications beyond IM include network management, content syndication, collaboration tools, file sharing, gaming, remote systems monitoring, web services, lightweight middleware, cloud computing, and much more.

* **Diverse** - a wide range of companies and open-source projects use XMPP to build and deploy real-time applications and services; you will never get “locked in” when you use XMPP technologies.

### Architecture

A typical XMPP network consists of several Servers/Domains connected together. The mechanism is similar to email where the servers are used as relays for the messages. Every entity on the XMPP network is addressed using a JabberID (JID). It has the form : username@domain/resource where domain is the domain name of the XMPP server, and username identifies an account on that server.

Server can have adapters/gateways to be able to talk to other protocols such as those used by ICQ, AIM, Yahoo and others.

Sometimes the servers are used only for signaling, in order to establish a media connection. [XEP-0166: Jingle](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0166.html) is a protocol extension for initiating and managing peer-to-peer media sessions between two XMPP entities.
