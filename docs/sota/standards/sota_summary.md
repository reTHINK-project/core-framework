#State of the Art Summary

The reTHINK project describes a framework that provides solutions to manage real time communication capabilities. To implement this framework the project team tried to use the most suitable existing standards which provides compability which existing technoligies. Using consolidated and widely used standards also make the development more efficient since Open Source libraries can be used in the developments. Addtionally to well-known standards, the project team has also tried to find emerging standards which can be adapted for ReTHINK requirements. In those cases, a tradeoff analysis has been made to determine if the choice of a not consolidated standard is optimal in terms of cost of use due to the lack of existing libraries and projects which use them.


   
The IETF has been creating and promoting the Internet standards since 1986. The IETF is organized in a large number of Working Groups (WG) which works on specific areas. For ReTHINK project, the team has focused on standards delivered by several WG (namely Rtcweb, TRAM, HTTP/2 and Network). The Rtcweb WG has defined a set of RFCs (many of them are still drafts) which are used in WebRTC, it defines how WebRTC works on the wire. Many of the used protocols already existed but many of them were created ad-hoc to meet WebRTC requirements. Other RFCs are informational and hes been released to gather the WG knowledge in a formal way. 
The TRAM (TURN Revised and Modernized) working group is carrying out a modernization of the protocols used to transport real-time media over Internet which is the final function of ReTHINK framework. 
HTTP/2 is the new version of HTTP/1.1 which has been used in the web for the last 16 years. It provides a new low level design to optimize current Web applications keeping the semmantic of HTTP/1.1 which is still valid. HTTP/1.1 has been historically transported over TCP, however to take advantage of all the new features of HTTP/2 a new transport protocol build over UDP has been designed: QUIC. HTTP/2 draft is based on SPDY but it includes new features and will soon become a definitive RFC. The draft belongs to the HTTP WG. QUIC was developed by Google but it has been recently become an IETF Draft taking over the last changes in the protocol until close the defintiive RFC. HTTP/2 over QUIC has been considered as an alternative for messaging in the ReTHINK framework as it is optimized to be used over wireless connection and minimizes the delay in every communication.
