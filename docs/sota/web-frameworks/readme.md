## State of the Art

Objective of the Service Framework is to develop a JavaScript Framework of libraries that can be used to facilitate the development of Hyperties. This framework will compliment the features provided by the Hyperty Runtime (T3.4) and Network QoS Policy Enforcement (T3.3). The end results of the Service Framework should support Hyperty Development (T5.2) which further assist in the implmentation of T5.3 Conversational Services (audio, video, chat, screen sharing) and T5.4 Context Enabled Services (Conversational Services, IoT, context delivery, location). 

This section analyses popularly used JavaScript Frameworks. The analysis of this Frameworks is based on the above identified requirments for the Service Framework:

* Service Framework MUST be Message Node agnostic
* Service Framework SHOULD be device agnostic
* Service Framework MUST avoid any JavaScript conflicts
* Service Framework MUST be Modular in nature
* Service Framework MUST be open source
* Service Framework MUST be light weight and fast
* Service Framework SHOULD support Model-View-Controller design pattern

The following JavaScript have been analyzed.

### [AngularJS (Google)](angular-js.md)

### [BackboneJS](backbone-js.md)

### [MeteorJS](meteor.md)

### [StapesJS](stapesjs.md)

### [Polymer] (polymer.md)
