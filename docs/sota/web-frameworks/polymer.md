### Polymer 1.0 Framework

Polymer 1.0 is a library designed to make it easier and faster for developers to implement rich, reusable components for the modern web.
It officially claims not to by a framework, but a complentary set of tools to be used with other frontend frameworks. 
It makes use of Web Components[46], which is a new set of standards designed to provide reusable DOM elements for the web. With it developers can
easily build thier own custom elements. For interoperability across browsers it provides the support of Polyfills for browsers that do not yet offer the new web APIs.
