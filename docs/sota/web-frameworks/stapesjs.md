### StapesJS Framework

#### Overview
StapesJS [53] is a little web framework designed to be agnostic about the setup and style of coding. It is very flexible and it allows to use MVC paradigm combined with libraries such as jQuery, Zepto, React and Rivets.
Stapes provides the necessary building blocks to build a apps in a short-time.

#### Advantages and main features
* It allows class creation, custom events, and data methods.
It only has 20 methods compared to other web-frameworks like Backbone which has more than 75.
* It is very light so the loading time will be very short. It is just 2kb (minified and gzipped) so it is suitable for web sites designed for mobile devices.
* It has around 600 lines of codes, so if any issue is find or it is necessary to add some new feature it can be done at a small cost.

#### Drawbacks
* It is less complete than other frameworks so some functionality may require some development.
* The last commit was done the Summer of 2014 so its contributors are not very active in Github. This may be a problem if any issue is found.

#### Requirement Analysis
* It is an Open Source project. It has MIT license which is a permissive free software license. meaning that it permits reuse within proprietary software provided all copies of the licensed software include a copy of the MIT License terms and the copyright notice. Such proprietary software retains its proprietary nature even though it incorporates software under the MIT License. It can be used without restrictions in the project.
* ReTHINK develeopments are not expected to be very complex so StapesJS could be a right choice. Additionally its small size will reduce the overhead in the applications which will help to reduce the load time.
