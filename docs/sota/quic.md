<h1>QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connection)</h1>

<h2>Rationale behind QUIC.</h2>
Internet has evolved a lot since the first version of TCP was designed 40 years ago. Many RFCs have added functionality to TCP since then
and it perform very well transporting the WWW for decades. UDP was designed to be used in real-time scenarios where the realiability is
not so important as getting a very low delay and being tolerant to  


<h2>Transport layer replacement</h2>
TCP and TLS have evolved a lot from the first version in 1974 (RFC675).
Improvements are constantly  done, however are gradual and take years.
TCP core characteristics remains the same: 
three-handshake
reliable, ordered and error-checked delivery based re-tx, acknowledgments and checksum
flow and congestion control based on slicing window. 
This has worked for many years but Internet needs are evolving as well: streaming-based services, wireless connections and mobile devices.
