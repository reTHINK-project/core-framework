Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications. Consisting of Docker Engine, a portable, lightweight runtime and packaging tool, and Docker Hub, a cloud service for sharing applications and automating workflows, Docker enables apps to be quickly assembled from components.

Docker is a platform for developers and sysadmins to develop, ship, and run applications. Docker lets you quickly assemble applications from components and eliminates the friction that can come when shipping code. Docker lets you get your code tested and deployed into production as fast as possible.

Docker consists of:

The Docker Engine -  lightweight and powerful open source container virtualization technology combined with a work flow for building and containerizing your applications.
Docker Hub - SaaS service for sharing and managing your application stacks.

Faster delivery of your applications

We want your environment to work better. Docker containers, and the work flow that comes with them, help your developers, sysadmins, QA folks, and release engineers work together to get your code into production and make it useful. It was created a standard container format that lets developers care about their applications inside containers while sysadmins and operators can work on running the container in your deployment. This separation of duties streamlines and simplifies the management and deployment of code.
It makes it easy to build new containers, enable rapid iteration of your applications, and increase the visibility of changes. This helps everyone in your organization understand how an application works and how it is built.
Docker containers are lightweight and fast! Containers have sub-second launch times, reducing the cycle time of development, testing, and deployment.

Deploy and scale more easily

Docker containers run (almost) everywhere. You can deploy containers on desktops, physical servers, virtual machines, into data centers, and up to public and private clouds.
Since Docker runs on so many platforms, it's easy to move your applications around. You can easily move an application from a testing environment into the cloud and back whenever you need.
Docker's lightweight containers also make scaling up and down fast and easy. You can quickly launch more containers when needed and then shut them down easily when they're no longer needed.
Get higher density and run more workloads

Docker containers don't need a hypervisor, so you can pack more of them onto your hosts. This means you get more value out of every server and can potentially reduce what you spend on equipment and licenses.

Faster deployment makes for easier management

As Docker speeds up your work flow, it gets easier to make lots of small changes instead of huge, big updates. Smaller changes mean reduced risk and more uptime.

What is Docker's architecture?
Docker uses a client-server architecture. The Docker client talks to the Docker daemon, which does the heavy lifting of building, running, and distributing your Docker containers. Both the Docker client and the daemon can run on the same system, or you can connect a Docker client to a remote Docker daemon. The Docker client and daemon communicate via sockets or through a RESTful API.
