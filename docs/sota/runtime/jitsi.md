RTP Relay.
Supports audio mixing.
Can be installed as Openfire plugin.
Call encryption with DTLS/SRTP.
Support for ICE

### Security
Encrypted password storage 
Password protection with a master password 
Encrypted Instant Messaging with Off-the-Record Messaging (OTRv4) 
Chat authentication with the Socialist Millionaire Protocol over OTR 
Call encryption with SRTP and ZRTP for XMPP and SIP 
Call encryption with SRTP and SDES for XMPP and SIP 
DNSSEC support 
TLS support and certificate-based client authentication for SIP and XMPP 

### Codecs
Audio: Opus, SILK, Speex, G.722, PCMU/PCMA (G.711), iLBC, GSM, G.729 Annex C (requires compilation and licenses) 
Video: H.264, H.263-1998 / H.263+, (VP8 coming soonâ€¦)

### Deploy
**Required software**
* JVM (select the latest version)
* XMPP Server (openfire, prosody.im, Tigase ...)
* Jitsi VideoBridge (stream XMPP component)
* Jicofo (Session handler XMPP component)
* NGINX (web server and proxy)
* Jitsi Meet App

**Domain selection**
* Select a name for a domain, "shumybridge" will be use for this example.
* Add an entry in DNS hosts file "127.0.0.1 shumybridge".

**XMPP Server (using Openfire)**
* Download and install openfire from http://www.igniterealtime.org/downloads/index.jsp
* Access admin console at http://localhost:9090
* For the machine name and XMPP domain is important that you use "shumybridge", server certificates will be generated for the domain.
* Select embedded SQLLite database, and an admin user account. Just enough for testing.
* On config "Server -> Server Settings -> HTTP Binding", enable "Script Syntax -> BOSH" and "Provides support for XFF (X-Forwarded-For) headers"
* On config "Server -> Server Settings -> External Components" enable and set the password, ex: xpassword

**Jitsi VideoBridge**
* Download and install Jitsi Videobridge from https://jitsi.org/Projects/JitsiVideobridge
* Run videobridge with: jvb --host=shumybridge --secret=xpassword
* You should see an entry in XMPP components like:
![image](openfire_videobridge.png)

**Jicofo Session**
* Clone from "git clone https://github.com/jitsi/jicofo.git"
* Ant build with "ant dist.{os-name}"
* Add lines "org.jitsi.impl.neomedia.transform.srtp.SRTPCryptoContext.checkReplay=false" and "org.jitsi.jicofo.auth.URL=XMPP:shumybridge" to the file sip-communicator.properties. In Windows this is located at "C:\Users\"user"\\.sip-communicator\sip-communicator.properties" or in linux "/usr/share/jicofo/.sip-communicator/sip-communicator.properties"
* Run videobridge with: jicofo --host=shumybridge --port=5275 --secret=xpassword
* You should see an entry in XMPP components like:

Conference focus is mandatory component of Jitsi Meet conferencing system next to the videobridge. It is responsible for managing media sessions between each of the participants and the videobridge. It will be creating **Jingle session** between Jitsi videobridge and the participant.
Although the session in terms of XMPP is between focus user and participant the media will flow between participant and the videobridge. That's because focus user will allocate **Colibri channels** on the bridge and use them as it's own Jingle transport.

**NGINX**
* Download and install from http://nginx.org/en/download.html
* Change nginx.conf file with:
```
server {
  listen       80;
  server_name  shumybridge;

	location ~ ^/([a-zA-Z0-9]+)$ {
		rewrite ^/(.*)$ / break;
	}
		
	location / {
		root      srv/jitsi.example.com;
		index     index.html;
	}

	# BOSH
	location /http-bind {
		proxy_pass      	http://shumybridge:7070/http-bind/;
		proxy_set_header 	X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
		proxy_set_header 	Host $http_host;
	}
     
  # redirect server error pages to the static page /50x.html
  error_page   500 502 503 504  /50x.html;
  location = /50x.html {
    root   html;
  }
}
```

**Jitsi Meet App**
* Clone or download Meet App from https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet.git
* Copy Meet App to NGINX folder ./srv/jitsi.example.com
* Change config.js file with:
```
var config = {
  hosts: {
    domain: 'shumybridge',
    muc: 'conference.shumybridge',
    bridge: 'jitsi-videobridge.shumybridge',
    focus: 'focus.shumybridge'
  },

  ...
  bosh: '//shumybridge/http-bind',
  clientNode: 'http://shumybridge/jitsimeet',
  ...
};
```

### Final Deploy Architecture

Run NGINX and access the Meet App at http://shumybridge and it will create a random room for anyone to join.

### Runtime Requirements Analysis
The overall developer documentation available is oriented for the client Jitsi Application

**SIP protocol** is available. It was tested with Jitsi client application, however documentation for setup of this in the videobridge is scarce. In theory SIP integration is possible.

**CUSAX WITH JITSI**, the CUSAX specification (RFC7081) describes suggested practices for the Combined Use of SIP And XMPP (hence the name). Such practices aim to provide a single fully featured real-time communication service by using each of the two protocols for what its best suited: SIP for audio/video calls. XMPP for everything else (e.g. IM, presence, server stored contact lists, avatars, file transfer, etc.)
