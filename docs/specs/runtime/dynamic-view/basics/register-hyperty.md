![Figure @runtime-register-hyperty: Register Hyperty](register-hyperty.png)


Step 1 : the Hyperty registration is requested by the Runtime UA triggered by the [Hyperty Deployment process](deploy-hyperty.md) (section ?).

Steps 2 and 3 : The Hyperty is associated to a certain [identity](../identity-management/user-to-hyperty-binding.md)(section ?)

Steps 4 - 10 : an Hyperty URL address is allocated in cooperation with the Msg Node Address Allocation functionality.

**Message to request address allocated for new Hyperty Instance**


```
"id" : "1"
"type" : "CREATE",
"from" : "hyperty-runtime://sp1/runalice/registry",
"to" : "sp1/msg-node/address-allocation",
"body" : { "hypertyUrl" : "hyperty://sp1/hy123" }
```

**Response Message returning the requested Hyperty Instance address**

```
"id" : "1"
"type" : "RESPONSE",
"from" : "sp1/msg-node/address-allocation",
"to" : "hyperty-runtime://sp1/runalice/registry",
"body" : { "hypertyInstanceURL" : "hyperty-instance://sp1/alice/hy123" }
```

Steps 11 - 15 : the Hyperty instance is registered in the back-end Registry

**Message to Register new Hyperty Instance**

```
"id" : "1"
"type" : "CREATE",
"from" : "hyperty-runtime://sp1/runalice",
"to" : "sp1/registry",
"body" : { "hypertyURL" : "hyperty://sp1/hy123", "hypertyInstanceURL" : "hyperty-instance://sp1/hy123,
"hypertyRuntimeURL" : "hyperty-runtime://sp1/runalice,
...}
```

Steps 16 - 17 : The runtime Registry adds its listener to be notified about Hyperty instance status and returns the Hyperty URL to the runtime UA
