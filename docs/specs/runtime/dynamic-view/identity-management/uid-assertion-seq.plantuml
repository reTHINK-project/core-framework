backend  -> hyperty     : Send(IdAssertion)
note right
        Bob's IdAssertion received through
        signaling of the Service Provider.
end note

hyperty  -> msgbus      : Verify(IdAssertion)
msgbus   -> runtime     : Verify(IdAssertion)
runtime  -> idp         : GetProxy(IdAssertion.proxy)
idp      -> runtime     : return(proxy)
create idpproxy
runtime  -> idpproxy    : <<create>>\n new IdPProxy(proxy)

note over idp
        May be two different server
        (repository and verify backend)
        but are shown here as the same
        participant.
end note

runtime  -> msgbus      : Verify(IdAssertion)
msgbus   -> idpproxy    : Verify(IdAssertion)
idpproxy -> idp         : Verify(IdAssertion)
activate idp
idp      -> idpproxy    : Verified(IdAssertion, validity)
deactivate idp
idpproxy -> msgbus      : Verified(IdAssertion, validity)
msgbus   -> runtime     : Verified(IdAssertion, validity)
note over runtime
        Received and validated IdAssertion
        could be stored for future reference.
        (e.g. last known assertion)
end note

runtime  -> msgbus      : Confirm(IdAssertion)
