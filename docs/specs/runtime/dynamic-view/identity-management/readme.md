### Identity Management dynamic view

**Kevin contribution:**

![Kevin proposal](identity-kevin.png)

**questions:**

* Identity Module similar to Runtime Arch Identities Container?
* If Yes, I would separate authorisation related functionalities from IDSelector/Vault to support other types of policies
* Endo IdP Proxy / Exo Proxy seems to be more related with protocol stubs ie it is a stub that enables runtime components to interact with back-end side Identity Management functionalities. Anyway, not clear the differences between the two 
* Registry / Discovery are runtime local?
