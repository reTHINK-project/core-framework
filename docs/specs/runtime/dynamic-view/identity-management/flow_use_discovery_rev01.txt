#! Usage of Smart Discovery Service
#! Alice is looking for Bob. All she knows about him is that Bob is from the city of "Bersabon" and that he works for "ABC Telecom"
#! Alice opens the Smart Discovery Website directly or uses her Client Software (open discovery)
#! to send the search query: "Bob";"Bersabon";"ABC" Telecom"
#! The Smart Discovery Service provides two UUIDs. One is pointing to a Hyperty of Bob running in his office environment and another one running in his private ones.
#! Alice clicks the office UUID. This one is resolved by the REGISTRY to a Hyperty URI.
#! Alices client software uses this URI to connect to Bobs Hyperty.
