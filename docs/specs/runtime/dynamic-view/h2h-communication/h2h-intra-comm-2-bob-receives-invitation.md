(Steps 1 - 4) : Service Provider Back-end Messaginge Service routes the message to Bob's Message BUS, asserts Alice's identity and forwards the message to Bobs Router reaching Bob's PEP component

(Step 4) : Bob's PEP applies local policies if required including incoming communication request access control

(Steps 5 - 8) : the message is forwarded to Bob's Syncher which creates the requested new objects and reports to Bob's Hyperty Instance the new created objects.

(Steps 9 - 13) : As soon as the new Objects were created by Bob's syncher, it responds back to Alice to confirm the objects were created with a [Response Message](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/architecture/tree/master/docs/datamodel/message#responsemessagebody).
