### H2H Intradomain Communication

To be aligned with the [Communication setup model based on the Reporter-Observer pattern](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/architecture/blob/master/docs/datamodel/communication/data-synch-communication-model.md)

As agreed in the conf call of 13th July, this use case is splitted into 2 diagrams:

#### [Alice Invites Bob](h2h-intra-comm-1-alice-invites.md)

#### [Bob receives Invitation from Alice](h2h-intra-comm-2-bob-receives-invitation.md)

#### [Alice is aknowledged Bob received Invitation](h2h-intra-comm-3-alice-is-aknowledged-invitation-received.md)

#### [Bob's App interaction and Alice's connection update] (h2h-intra-comm-4-notification-update.md)

#### [Bob gathers WebRTC resources] (h2h-intra-comm-5-bob-webrtc.md)

#### [Synchronization of Alice's Data Object] (h2h-intra-comm-6-alice-DO-synch.md)



### H2H Inter-domain Communication

#### [Alice Invites Bob](h2h-inter-comm-1-alice-invites.md)

#### [Bob receives Invitation from Alice](h2h-inter-comm-2-bob-receives-invitation.md)

#### [Alice is aknowledged Bob received Invitation](h2h-inter-comm-3-alice-is-aknowledged-invitation-received.md)

#### [Bob's App interaction and Alice's connection update] (h2h-inter-comm-4-notification-update.md)

#### [Bob gathers WebRTC resources] (h2h-inter-comm-5-bob-webrtc.md)

#### [Synchronization of Alice's Data Object] (h2h-inter-comm-6-alice-DO-synch.md)
