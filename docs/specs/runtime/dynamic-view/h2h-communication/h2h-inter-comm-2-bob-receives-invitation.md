![H2H Interdomain Communication : bob receives invitation](h2h-inter-comm-2-bob-receives-invitation.png)


(Steps 1 - 3) : The Service Provider 2 Stub that has been deployed in Alice's Runtime sends the message to Bob's Message BUS, asserts Alice's identity and forwards the message to Bobs Router reaching Bob's PEP component

(Step 4) : Bob's PEP applies local policies if required including incoming communication request access control

(Steps 5 - 8) : the message is forwarded to Bob's Syncher which creates the requested new objects and reports to Bob's Hyperty Instance the new created objects.

(Steps 9 - 10) : As soon as the new Objects were created by Bob's syncher, it responds back to Alice to confirm the objects were created with a [Response Message](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/architecture/tree/master/docs/datamodel/message#responsemessagebody).

```
"id" : "1"
"type" : "RESPONSE",
"from" : "hyperty-instance://sp1/bobhy123",
"to" : "hyperty-instance://sp1/alicehy123",
"contextId" : "qwertyuiopasdfghjkl",
"body" : { "code" : "200" , "description" : "ok"}
```


(Step 11) : The message Bus sends the message to Alice via the SP2 stub, deployed in Alice's runtime
