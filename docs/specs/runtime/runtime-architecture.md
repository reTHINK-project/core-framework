Runtime Architecture
--------------------

The main Hyperty Runtime architecture is comprised by different types of components that, for security reasons, are executed in isolated sandboxes. Thus, components downloaded from a specific Service Provider (e.g. Service Provider 1) are executed in sandboxes that are different from the sandboxes used to execute components downloaded from another service provider (e.g. Service Provider 2). In addition, for the same Service Provider, and also for security reasons, protocol stubs and Hyperties are isolated from each other and executed in different sandboxes. Communication between components running in different sandboxes is only possible through messages exchanged through a Message Bus functionality provided by the Core Sandbox. On the other hand, the Protocol Stub provides the bridge for the Hyperty Runtime to communicate with associated Service Provider. For example, in Figure below, protostub1 is the only way that Hyperty instances have to communicate with Service Provider 1. In general, in the Core Sandbox, all required functionalities to support the deployment, execution and maintenance of components downloaded from service providers, are executed. Core components are, ideally, natively part of the device runtime. However, to support existing platforms including Browsers and Mobile Operating Systems, to minimise the need to install new applications, the existing device native runtime functionalities (e.g. JavaScript engine) are distinguished from the Hyperty Core Runtime functionalities. In such situations, the Hyperty Core Runtime components are downloaded from the Hyperty Runtime Service Provider and are executed in an isolated core sandbox.

![Figure @runtime_arch_high_level High Level Runtime Architecture with trusted Hyperties](Runtime_Architecture_high_level.png)

The Application and the Hyperty can be delivered by the same Service Provider or by different Service Providers, i.e. Hyperty is delivered by an (Hyperty) Service Provider and the Application is delivered by an Application Service Provider. These two different situations impacts the level of trust between the Application and the Hyperty, that should be handled by the Hyperty Runtime accordingly.

In Figure above, the Application and the Hyperty Instances it consumes, are downloaded from the same Service Provider. Thus, it is assumed they trust each other and that they can be executed in the same sandbox with no impact on how the Application consumes the Hyperty Application API. In Figure below, it is depicted the Runtime Architecture where the Application and the Hyperty Instances it consumes, don't trust each other, for example, they are downloaded from different service providers. In such situation, Hyperties and the Application are isolated from each other and they are executed in different sandboxes. In this case, the Hyperty Application API is no longer local and the application is only able to reach the Hyperty Instance through the Message BUS. It is desirable to abstract the Application developer from these situations and to let the Application developer call the Hyperty Application API as if they are always local. This implies that the Core Runtime and the Sandbox implementation, is able to support a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) communication when the Application and the Hyperty Instance are in different sandboxes.

As described below, to prevent cross origin attacks / spy, access to Core Runtime Message BUS is subject to authorisation, by using standardised policies downloaded from each involved Service Provider. In addition, the Hyperty Runtime Architecture also supports Hyperty Interceptors executed in a dedicated sandbox (see Figure below) enabling the enforcement of proprietary policies.

![Figure @runtime_arch_high_level_pep High Level Runtime Architecture with domain specific Policy Enforcer](Runtime_Architecture_high_level_pep.png)

In addition, Core Policy Engine should enforce general access control policies that are agnostic of sender and target domains, or specific to the domain managing the device runtime (Core Runtime Provider). The policies used to control the access to [Hyperty Data Objects](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-service-framework/blob/master/docs/manuals/p2p-data-sync.md) (see below) , are a good example of such policies.

Some more details are provided in the following sections.

### Service Provider Sandboxes

#### Hyperty

As [previously defined, Hyperties](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-service-framework/blob/master/docs/manuals/hyperty.md) cooperate each other via P2P Synchronisation of Hyperty JSON Data Objects supported by the novel [Reporter - Observer communication pattern](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-service-framework/blob/master/docs/manuals/p2p-data-sync.md) and on top of the [Hyperty Messaging Framework](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-service-framework/blob/develop/docs/manuals/hyperty-messaging-framework.md).

#### Hyperty Interceptor

Hyperty Interceptor complements the Core Policy Engine functionality enabling the enforcement of proprietary or closed Policies in the Hyperty Runtime for a specific Hyperty instance.

#### Protocol Stub

The Protocol Stub implements a protocol stack to be used to communicate with the Service Provider's backend servers (including Messaging Server or other functionalities like IdM) according to [Protocol on the Fly](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/dev-service-framework/blob/develop/docs/manuals/hyperty-messaging-framework.md#protocol-on-the-fly-protofly-and-protostubs) concept.

Protocol stubs are only reachable through the Message BUS. In this way it is ensured that all messages received and sent goes through the message bus where policies can be enforced and additional data can be added or changed including identity tokens.

### Core Runtime

The Core Runtime components are depicted in Figure below.

![Figure @runtime_arch_core Runtime Core Architecture](Core_Runtime.png)

Runtime Core components should be as much as possible independent on the Runtime type. They should be deployed once and executed at the background. The next time the runtime is started there should be no need to download the core runtime again unless there is a new version. Runtime core components instances should be shared by different Apps and Hyperty instances.

The Core Runtime is provided by a specific Service Provider (the Core Runtime Service Provider) that handles a Catalogue service to with Runtime Descriptors and a Registry service to handle the registration of Runtime instances.

#### Message BUS

The Message Bus Supports local message communication in a loosely coupled manner between Service Provider sandboxes including Hyperty Instances, Protocol Stubs and Policy Enforcers. Messages are routed to listeners previously added by the Runtime User Agent, to valid Runtime URL addresses handled by the Runtime Registry functionality.

Access to Message Bus is subject to authorisation to prevent cross origin attacks / spy from malicious downloaded code including Hyperties, Protocol Stubs or Policy Enforcers.

#### Core Policy Engine

The Core Policy Engine provides Policy decision and Policy Enforcement functionalities for incoming and outgoing messages from / to Service Provider sandboxes, according to Policies downloaded and stored locally when associated Hyperties are deployed by the Runtime User Agent. It also provides authorisation / access control to the Message BUS.

The verification or generation of identity assertions, to get valid Access tokens, are two examples of actions ruled by policies.

#### Runtime Registry

The Runtime Registry handles the registration of all available runtime components including Core components, Service Provider Sandboxes and each component executing in each sandbox like Hyperty Instances, Protocol Stubs, Hyperty Inteceptors and Applications.

The Runtime Registry handles the allocation of Runtime URL addresses for all these components and manages its status.

In addition, the Runtime Registry ensures synchronisation with Back-end Service Provider's Domain Registry.

#### Identity Module

The Runtime Identity Module manages ID and Access Tokens required to trustfully manage Hyperty Instances communication including trustful association between Hyperty Instances with Users. In addition, it also supports the generation and validation of Identity assertions. Identity module is an extension of [WebRTC Identity](http://w3c.github.io/WebRTC-pc/#identity) and interacts with Identity Providers via IDP Proxy protostubs.

Messages routed by Message Bus should be signed with a token according to the Identity associated to it and managed by the Identity Module.

#### Runtime User Agent

The Runtime User Agent, manages Core Sandbox components including its download, deployment and update from Core Runtime Provider. It also handles Device bootstrap and the deployment and update of Service Provider sandboxes including Hyperties, Protocol Stubs and Policy Enforcers, via the Runtime Catalogue.

#### Runtime Catalogue

The Runtime Catalogue manages the descriptors of deployable components and Hyperty Data Object schemas that are downloaded from the Service Provider Catalogue via the [Catalogue Service interface](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/architecture/blob/master/docs/interface-design/Interface-Design.md#73-catalogue-interface). The Runtime Catalogue ensures synchronisation with Back-end Catalogue servers.

#### Persistence Manager

The Persistence Manager provides data storage functionalities (write and read) to Core Runtime Components including Runtime Catalogue, Runtime Registry, Policy Engine and Graph Connector.

#### Sync Manager

The Sync Manager is in charge of handling authorisation requests to create Sync Data Objects and subscription requests to Sync Data Objects. As soon as authorisation is granted the Sync Manager handles all required MessageBUS listeners in order to setup the Data Sync Stream routing path among Hyperties.

#### QoS User Agent

The QoS User Agent Manages network QoS in the runtime. This component requires further investigations which will be reported later.

#### Graph Connector

The Graph Connector is a local address book maintaining a list of trustful communication users. This functionality is further detailed in deliverable D4.2.

### Native Runtime

The Native Runtime provides Functionalities that are natively provided by the runtime, e.g. JavaScript engine or WebRTC Media Engine to support for Stream communication between Hyperties according to WebRTC Standards when available.
