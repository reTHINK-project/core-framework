## Service Framework 

Hyperty Framework is a Software Development Toolkit (SDK) aims at facilitating the development of Hyperties to be executed within the reTHINK architecture. The functionalities provided by the Hyperty Framework will complement the functionalities of the Hyperty Runtime and functionalities provided for the Network QoS component. The main objective is to provide JavaScript libraries in speeding up the implementation of conversational services (audio, video, chat, screen sharing) and context enabled services (IoT, context delivery, location). These services will be fully implemented in WP5 and demonstrated in WP6.
The requirements from a software perspective have been defined in section 2.4. In this chapter, a preliminary set of requirements from the reTHINK concept will be discussed and a high level capability set for the Framework will be presented. For this input from three different areas of the reTHINK project will be examined namely:
* Uses Cases as specified in WP1 Task1.1
* Data Models as specified in WP2 Task 2.3
* Interface Design  as specified in WP2 Task 2.4

### Use Cases
D1.1 – “Use Cases and Sustainable Business Models” specified 15 user scenarios from which 5 have been selected as the main scenarios for the development of Hyperties in WP5. Details of these user scenarios can be found in D1.1 [ref]. 
* Daily life in a Smart City – Human-To-Human Communication
* Daily Life In A Smart City – Individual Contextual Services
* Hotel Guest Web Application
* Apartment Rental Monitoring And Control Application
* Smart Enterprise –Contextual Enriched Communication in Smart Enterprises 

From the above user scenarios specific use case and requirments in the sense of service logic for these use cases where identified and specified. These information act as information pool upon which the functionalities of the Hyperty Framework will be based.
