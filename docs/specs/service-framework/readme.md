## Service Framework 

Hyperty Framework is a Software Development Toolkit (SDK) aimed at facilitating the development of Hyperties to be executed within the reTHINK architecture. The functionalities provided by the Hyperty Framework will complement the functionalities of the Hyperty Runtime and functionalities provided for the network QoS. The main objective is to provide JavaScript libraries in speeding up the implementation of conversational services (audio, video, chat, screen sharing) and context enabled services (IoT, context delivery, location). These services will be fully implemented in WP5 and demonstrated in WP6.
The requirements from a software perspective have been defined in section 2.4. In this chapter, a preliminary set of requirements from the reTHINK concept will be discussed and a high level capability set for the Framework will be presented. For this input from three different areas of the reTHINK project will be examined namely:
* Uses Cases as specified in WP1 Task1.1
* Data Models as specified in WP2 Task 2.3
* Interface Design  as specified in WP2 Task 2.4
