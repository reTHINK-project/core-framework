### CommunicationFactory

The CommunicationFactory creates communication objects according to the [Communication Data Model](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/architecture/tree/master/docs/datamodel/communication/readme.md). 

####Communication Data Object
--------------------------------------
The Communication Object has following class object attributes:
* ```id``` - the identifier of the created comunication
* ```host``` - 
* ```owner``` - initiator of the communication (from Participant Data Object)
* ```startingTime``` - Date representation of the start time when the communication was created
* ```lastModified``` - Date representation of last modified time of the created communication
* ```duration``` - String representation of the duration of the session.
* ```status``` - representation of the status (OPEN|PENDING|CLOSED|PAUSED|FAILED)
* ```participants``` - list of participant data objects representing participants with their status and resources (ConnectionDataObject)
* ```comunicationQuality```- 


#####Participant Data Object
* ```identityObject``` - Identity Data Object as defined in the [User Identity Data Model](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/architecture/blob/master/docs/datamodel/user-identity/readme.md)
* ```resourceObject``` -  Hyperty Resource Data Object

#####[Connection Data Object](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/blob/master/docs/specs/service-framework/sf_connection_factory.md)

#####[Hyperty Resource Data Model](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/blob/master/docs/specs/service-framework/sf_hyperty_resource_factory.md)

###Functions
-----------------------
Define and specify functionalities from the [dynamic views](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/tree/master/docs/specs/runtime/dynamic-view) that relate in creating and managing Hyperty Resource Data Objects.


####createCommunicationDataObject
Generates a class object of the communication data object
```
createCommunicationDataObject(Paricipant owner, Participantlist participants)
```

####createConversationResource
Creates a new Hyperty Resource of type ConnectionDataObject
```
createConversationResource(Participant owner)
```

#### addParticipant
Adds a new participant to the list of participants. Note that each participant has a connectionDataObject which should be created as well (thinking: use the createConversationResource) 
```
addConversationParticipant(Identity participant, HypertyResource.Connection connection)
```

#### removeParticipant
Removes the given participant from the list of participants.  
```
removeParticipant(Identity participant, HypertyResource.Connection connection)
```
