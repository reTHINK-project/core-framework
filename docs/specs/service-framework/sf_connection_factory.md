### Connection Factory

The Connection Factory creates [Connection Data Objects](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/architecture/blob/master/docs/datamodel/Connection-Data-Object-Model.png) used in the [Communication Data Factory](https://github.com/reTHINK-project/core-framework/blob/master/docs/specs/service-framework/sf_communication_factory.md). 

#####Connection Data Object
* ```status``` - 
* ``` owner``` - Communication. participant
* ``` localIceCandidates``` - status of the local IceCandidates (NEW|CHECKING|CONNECTED|COMPLETED|FAILED|DISCONNECTED|CLOSED) 
* ``` remoteIceCandidates``` - status of the remote IceCandidates (NEW|CHECKING|CONNECTED|COMPLETED|FAILED|DISCONNECTED|CLOSED)
* ``` localConnectionDescription``` - String representation of local SDP (offer) - Reporter DataObject (Reports changes made locally)
* ``` remoteConnectionDescription``` - String representation of remote SDP (answer) - Observation DataObject (Observes changes made remotely)
