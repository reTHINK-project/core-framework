Usage of the emerging [object.observe](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-PT/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/observe) javascript API to support Hyperty communication based on object synchronisation. If not supported by the native runtime we can use a few [existing libraries](https://github.com/MaxArt2501/object-observe).

### Experimentation

![hyperty data synchronisation communication experimentation](hyperty-data-synchronisation-msc.png)

[Source code](src/observer-test)

**Results**

* Every time an object/field is created, we need to add it to the observer system.
* The API is available natively on Chrome, no need for the polyfill.
* Not available on IE, but the polyfill works fine.

**questions:**
* concurrency (ie both hyperties change the same attribute at "the same time" creating inconsistence between the two objects) will be addressed in other experimentations
* To simplify, concurrency may be handled by only granting writing permissions to Object owner (creator). Such control would be enforced by the Msg BUS Access control.
* In case more sophisticated concurrency control is needed we may look on existing solutions like [sync-it](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sync-it)

**Other Candidate Libraries**

Should we also have a look on the libraries below?

*[Swarm](https://github.com/gritzko/swarm) is an isomorphic reactive M-of-MVC library that synchronizes objects in real-time and may work offline. Swarm is safely described as “data sync middleware”. Like git repos, Swarm replicas are peers, so there is no master copy. As a byproduct, Swarm supports local data caches and P2P serverless sync.*

*[Secure Scuttlebutt](https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-docs) is a decentralized network which gossips blockchains in a peer-to-peer mesh. It is an alternative to hosted Web applications, with greater protections for user data and greater freedom to choose your software.*
