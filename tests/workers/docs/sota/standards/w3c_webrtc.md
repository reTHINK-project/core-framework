The Web Real-Time Communications Working Group was created in May 2011 within the W3C to define client-side APIs to enable Real-Time Communications in Web browsers.

It has defined a functional WebRTC 1.0 API which is implemented by major browser vendors to build real-time media applications in the browser without the need of installing any additional plugin. 

Together with WebRTC 1.0 API the W3C is working in a series of drafts for:
- Media Capture and Streams (getUserMedia): set of JavaScript APIs that allow local media, including audio and video, to be requested from a platform
- MediaStream Recording: a recording API for use with MediaStreams as defined in [GETUSERMEDIA]
- MediaStream Image Capture: specific the takePhoto() and grabFrame() methods, and corresponding camera settings for use with MediaStreams as defined in Media Capture and Streams [GETUSERMEDIA]
- Media Capture Depth Stream Extensions: extends the Media Capture and Streams specification [GETUSERMEDIA] to allow a depth stream to be requested from the web platform using APIs familiar to web authors.
- Media Capture from DOM Elements: defines how a stream of media can be captured from a DOM element, such as a <video>, <audio>, or <canvas> element, in the form of a MediaStream [GETUSERMEDIA].
- Audio output devices API: defines a set of JavaScript APIs that let a Web application manage how audio is rendered on the user audio output devices.
- Identifiers for WebRTC's Statistics API: defines a set of Javascript APIs that allow access to the statistical information about a PeerConnection
- Screen Capture:  defines how a user's display, or parts thereof, can be used as the source of a media stream using getOutputMedia, an extension to the Media Capture API [GETUSERMEDIA].
