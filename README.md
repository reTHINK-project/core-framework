# core-framework
The main goal of WP3 is to provide the reTHINK core framework comprised by the runtime environment where Hyperties are executed and the messaging nodes used to support messages exchange between Hyperties. 

An existing open source Web engine will be selected to use as a base for the Hyperty runtime, and special attention will be given to the WebRTC media engine extension as well as to the security components needed to implement Governance User Agents. A Hyperty javascript framework will be developed on top of the Hyperty runtime to facilitate the development of new Hyperties in WP5. The Hyperty runtime will be ported into different devices such as smartphones, M2M/IoT devices or gateways, TV sets and STBs according to the use cases defined in WP1. WP3 also aims to provide different Messaging Nodes to be used in the different trial domains in WP6.
